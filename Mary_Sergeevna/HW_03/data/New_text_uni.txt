and these two very old people are the father and mother of mrs bucket  their names are grandpa george and grandma georgina 
this is mr bucket  this is mrs bucket 
mr and mrs bucket have a small boy whose name is charlie 
this is charlie 
how d you do  and how d you do  and how d you do again  he is pleased to meet you 
the whole of this family  the six grown ups  count them  and little charlie bucket   live together in a small wooden house on the edge of a great town 
the house wasn t nearly large enough for so many people  and life was extremely uncomfortable for them all  there were only two rooms in the place altogether  and there was only one bed  the bed was given to the four old grandparents because they were so old and tired  they were so tired  they never got out of it 
grandpa joe and grandma josephine on this side  grandpa george and grandma georgina on this side 
mr and mrs bucket and little charlie bucket slept in the other room  upon mattresses on the floor 
in the summertime  this wasn t too bad  but in the winter  freezing cold draughts blew across the floor all night long  and it was awful 
there wasn t any question of them being able to buy a better house  or even one more bed to sleep in  they were far too poor for that 
mr bucket was the only person in the family with a job  he worked in a toothpaste factory  where he sat all day long at a bench and screwed the little caps on to the tops of the tubes of toothpaste after the tubes had been filled  but a toothpaste cap screwer is never paid very much money  and poor mr bucket  however hard he worked  and however fast he screwed on the caps  was never able to make enough to buy one half of the things that so large a family needed  there wasn t even enough money to buy proper food for them all  the only meals they could afford were bread and margarine for breakfast  boiled potatoes and cabbage for lunch  and cabbage soup for supper  sundays were a bit better  they all looked forward to sundays because then  although they had exactly the same  everyone was allowed a second helping 
the buckets  of course  didn t starve  but every one of them  the two old grandfathers  the two old grandmothers  charlie s father  charlie s mother  and especially little charlie himself   went about from morning till night with a horrible empty feeling in their tummies 
charlie felt it worst of all  and although his father and mother often went without their own share of lunch or supper so that they could give it to him  it still wasn t nearly enough for a growing boy  he desperately wanted something more filling and satisfying than cabbage and cabbage soup  the one thing he longed for more than anything else was  chocolate 
walking to school in the mornings  charlie could see great slabs of chocolate piled up high in the shop windows  and he would stop and stare and press his nose against the glass  his mouth watering like mad  many times a day  he would see other children taking bars of creamy chocolate out of their pockets and munching them greedily  and that  of course  was pure torture 
only once a year  on his birthday  did charlie bucket ever get to taste a bit of chocolate  the whole family saved up their money for that special occasion  and when the great day arrived  charlie was always presented with one small chocolate bar to eat all by himself  and each time he received it  on those marvellous birthday mornings  he would place it carefully in a small wooden box that he owned  and treasure it as though it were a bar of solid gold  and for the next few days  he would allow himself only to look at it  but never to touch it  then at last  when he could stand it no longer  he would peel back a tiny bit of the paper wrapping at one corner to expose a tiny bit of chocolate  and then he would take a tiny nibble  just enough to allow the lovely sweet taste to spread out slowly over his tongue  the next day  he would take another tiny nibble  and so on  and so on  and in this way  charlie would make his sixpenny bar of birthday chocolate last him for more than a month 
but i haven t yet told you about the one awful thing that tortured little charlie  the lover of chocolate  more than anything else  this thing  for him  was far  far worse than seeing slabs of chocolate in the shop windows or watching other children munching bars of creamy chocolate right in front of him  it was the most terrible torturing thing you could imagine  and it was this 
in the town itself  actually within sight of the house in which charlie lived  there was an enormous chocolate factory 
just imagine that 
and it wasn t simply an ordinary enormous chocolate factory  either  it was the largest and most famous in the whole world  it was wonka s factory  owned by a man called mr willy wonka  the greatest inventor and maker of chocolates that there has ever been 
and what a tremendous  marvellous place it was  it had huge iron gates leading into it  and a high wall surrounding it  and smoke belching from its chimneys  and strange whizzing sounds coming from deep inside it  and outside the walls  for half a mile around in every direction  the air was scented with the heavy rich smell of melting chocolate 
twice a day  on his way to and from school  little charlie bucket had to walk right past the gates of the factory  and every time he went by  he would begin to walk very  very slowly  and he would hold his nose high in the air and take long deep sniffs of the gorgeous chocolatey smell all around him 
oh  how he loved that smell 
and oh  how he wished he could go inside the factory and see what it was like 
 
mr willy wonka s factory
in the evenings  after he had finished his supper of watery cabbage soup  charlie always
went into the room of his four grandparents to listen to their stories  and then afterwards to
say good night 
every one of these old people was over ninety  they were as shrivelled as prunes  and as bony as skeletons  and throughout the day  until charlie made his appearance  they lay huddled in their one bed  two at either end  with nightcaps on to keep their heads warm  dozing the time away with nothing to do  but as soon as they heard the door opening  and heard charlie s voice saying   good evening  grandpa joe and grandma josephine  and grandpa george and grandma georgina   then all four of them would suddenly sit up  and their old wrinkled faces would light up with smiles of pleasure  and the talking would begin  for they loved this little boy  he was the only bright thing in their lives  and his evening visits were something that they looked forward to all day long  often  charlie s mother and father would come in as well  and stand by the door  listening to the stories that the old people told  and thus  for perhaps half an hour every night  this room would become a happy place  and the whole family would forget that it was hungry and poor 
one evening  when charlie went in to see his grandparents  he said to them   is it really true that wonka s chocolate factory is the biggest in the world  
 true   cried all four of them at once   of course it s true  good heavens  didn t you know that  it s about fifty times as big as any other  
 and is mr willy wonka really the cleverest chocolate maker in the world  
 my dear boy   said grandpa joe  raising himself up a little higher on his pillow   mr willy wonka is the most amazing  the most fantastic  the most extraordinary chocolate maker the world has ever seen  i thought everybody knew that  
 i knew he was famous  grandpa joe  and i knew he was very clever  
 clever   cried the old man   he s more than that  he s a magician with chocolate  he can make anything  anything he wants  isn t that a fact  my dears  
the other three old people nodded their heads slowly up and down  and said   absolutely true  just as true as can be  
and grandpa joe said   you mean to say i ve never told you about mr willy wonka and his factory  
 never   answered little charlie 
 good heavens above  i don t know what s the matter with me  
 will you tell me now  grandpa joe  please  
 i certainly will  sit down beside me on the bed  my dear  and listen carefully  
grandpa joe was the oldest of the four grandparents  he was ninety six and a half  and that is just about as old as anybody can be  like all extremely old people  he was delicate and weak  and throughout the day he spoke very little  but in the evenings  when charlie  his beloved grandson  was in the room  he seemed in some marvellous way to grow quite young again  all his tiredness fell away from him  and he became as eager and excited as a young boy 
 oh  what a man he is  this mr willy wonka   cried grandpa joe   did you know  for example  that he has himself invented more than two hundred new kinds of chocolate bars  each with a different centre  each far sweeter and creamier and more delicious than anything the other chocolate factories can make  
 perfectly true   cried grandma josephine   and he sends them to all the four corners of the earth  isn t that so  grandpa joe  
 it is  my dear  it is  and to all the kings and presidents of the world as well  but it isn t only chocolate bars that he makes  oh  dear me  no  he has some really fantastic inventions up his sleeve  mr willy wonka has  did you know that he s invented a way of making chocolate ice cream so that it stays cold for hours and hours without being in the refrigerator  you can even leave it lying in the sun all morning on a hot day and it won t go runny  
 but that s impossible   said little charlie  staring at his grandfather 
 of course it s impossible   cried grandpa joe   it s completely absurd  but mr willy wonka has done it  
 quite right   the others agreed  nodding their heads   mr wonka has done it  
 and then again   grandpa joe went on speaking very slowly now so that charlie wouldn t miss a word   mr willy wonka can make marshmallows that taste of violets  and rich caramels that change colour every ten seconds as you suck them  and little feathery sweets that melt away deliciously the moment you put them between your lips  he can make chewing gum that never loses its taste  and sugar balloons that you can blow up to enormous sizes before you pop them with a pin and gobble them up  and  by a most secret method  he can make lovely blue birds  eggs with black spots on them  and when you put one of these in your mouth  it gradually gets smaller and smaller until suddenly there is nothing left except a tiny little pink sugary baby bird sitting on the tip of your tongue  
grandpa joe paused and ran the point of his tongue slowly over his lips   it makes my mouth water just thinking about it   he said 
 mine  too   said little charlie   but please go on  
while they were talking  mr and mrs bucket  charlie s mother and father  had come quietly into the room  and now both were standing just inside the door  listening 
 tell charlie about that crazy indian prince   said grandma josephine   he d like to hear that  
 you mean prince pondicherry   said grandpa joe  and he began chuckling with laughter   completely dotty   said grandpa george   but very rich   said grandma georgina   what did he do   asked charlie eagerly   listen   said grandpa joe   and i ll tell you  
 
mr wonka and the indian prince
 prince pondicherry wrote a letter to mr willy wonka   said grandpa joe   and asked him to
come all the way out to india and build him a colossal palace entirely out of chocolate  
 did mr wonka do it  grandpa  
 he did  indeed  and what a palace it was  it had one hundred rooms  and everything was made of either dark or light chocolate  the bricks were chocolate  and the cement holding them together was chocolate  and the windows were chocolate  and all the walls and ceilings were made of chocolate  so were the carpets and the pictures and the furniture and the beds  and when you turned on the taps in the bathroom  hot chocolate came pouring out 
 when it was all finished  mr wonka said to prince pondicherry   i warn you  though  it won t last very long  so you d better start eating it right away  
  nonsense   shouted the prince   i m not going to eat my palace  i m not even going to nibble the staircase or lick the walls  i m going to live in it  
 but mr wonka was right  of course  because soon after this  there came a very hot day with a boiling sun  and the whole palace began to melt  and then it sank slowly to the ground  and the crazy prince  who was dozing in the living room at the time  woke up to find himself swimming around in a huge brown sticky lake of chocolate  
little charlie sat very still on the edge of the bed  staring at his grandfather  charlie s face was bright  and his eyes were stretched so wide you could see the whites all around   is all this really true   he asked   or are you pulling my leg  
 it s true   cried all four of the old people at once   of course it s true  ask anyone you like  
 and i ll tell you something else that s true   said grandpa joe  and now he leaned closer to charlie  and lowered his voice to a soft  secret whisper   nobody  ever   comes   out  
 out of where   asked charlie 
 and  nobody   ever   goes   in  
 in where   cried charlie 
 wonka s factory  of course  
 grandpa  what do you mean  
 i mean workers  charlie  
 workers  
 all factories   said grandpa joe   have workers streaming in and out of the gates in the mornings and evenings  except wonka s  have you ever seen a single person going into that place   or coming out  
little charlie looked slowly around at each of the four old faces  one after the other  and they all looked back at him  they were friendly smiling faces  but they were also quite serious  there was no sign of joking or leg pulling on any of them 
 well  have you   asked grandpa joe 
 i  i really don t know  grandpa   charlie stammered   whenever i walk past the factory  the gates seem to be closed  
 exactly   said grandpa joe 
 but there must be people working there  
 not people  charlie  not ordinary people  anyway  
 then who   cried charlie 
 ah ha  that s it  you see   that s another of mr willy wonka s clevernesses  
 charlie  dear   mrs bucket called out from where she was standing by the door   it s time for bed  that s enough for tonight  
 but  mother  i must hear  
 tomorrow  my darling  
 that s right   said grandpa joe   i ll tell you the rest of it tomorrow evening  
 
the secret workers
the next evening  grandpa joe went on with his story 
 you see  charlie   he said   not so very long ago there used to be thousands of people working in mr willy wonka s factory  then one day  all of a sudden  mr wonka had to ask every single one of them to leave  to go home  never to come back  
 but why   asked charlie   because of spies    spies  
 yes  all the other chocolate makers  you see  had begun to grow jealous of the wonderful sweets that mr wonka was making  and they started sending in spies to steal his secret recipes  the spies took jobs in the wonka factory  pretending that they were ordinary workers  and while they were there  each one of them found out exactly how a certain special thing was made  
 and did they go back to their own factories and tell   asked charlie 
 they must have   answered grandpa joe   because soon after that  fickelgruber s factory started making an ice cream that would never melt  even in the hottest sun  then mr prodnose s factory came out with a chewing gum that never lost its flavour however much you chewed it  and then mr slugworth s factory began making sugar balloons that you could blow up to huge sizes before you popped them with a pin and gobbled them up  and so on  and so on  and mr willy wonka tore his beard and shouted   this is terrible  i shall be ruined  there are spies everywhere  i shall have to close the factory   
 but he didn t do that   charlie said 
 oh  yes he did  he told all the workers that he was sorry  but they would have to go home  then  he shut the main gates and fastened them with a chain  and suddenly  wonka s giant chocolate factory became silent and deserted  the chimneys stopped smoking  the machines stopped whirring  and from then on  not a single chocolate or sweet was made  not a soul went in or out  and even mr willy wonka himself disappeared completely 
 months and months went by   grandpa joe went on   but still the factory remained closed  and everybody said   poor mr wonka  he was so nice  and he made such marvellous things  but he s finished now  it s all over  
 then something astonishing happened  one day  early in the morning  thin columns of white smoke were seen to be coming out of the tops of the tall chimneys of the factory  people in the town stopped and stared   what s going on   they cried   someone s lit the furnaces  mr wonka must be opening up again   they ran to the gates  expecting to see them wide open and mr wonka standing there to welcome his workers back 
 but no  the great iron gates were still locked and chained as securely as ever  and mr wonka was nowhere to be seen 
  but the factory is working   the people shouted   listen  you can hear the machines  they re all whirring again  and you can smell the smell of melting chocolate in the air   
grandpa joe leaned forward and laid a long bony finger on charlie s knee  and he said softly   but most mysterious of all  charlie  were the shadows in the windows of the factory  the people standing on the street outside could see small dark shadows moving about behind the frosted glass windows  
 shadows of whom   said charlie quickly 
 that s exactly what everybody else wanted to know 
 the place is full of workers   the people shouted   but nobody s gone in  the gates are locked  it s crazy  nobody ever comes out  either  
 but there was no question at all   said grandpa joe   that the factory was running  and it s gone on running ever since  for these last ten years  what s more  the chocolates and sweets it s been turning out have become more fantastic and delicious all the time  and of course now when mr wonka invents some new and wonderful sweet  neither mr fickelgruber nor mr prodnose nor mr slugworth nor anybody else is able to copy it  no spies can go into the factory to find out how it is made  
 but grandpa  who   cried charlie   who is mr wonka using to do all the work in the factory  
 nobody knows  charlie  
 but that s absurd  hasn t someone asked mr wonka  
 nobody sees him any more  he never comes out  the only things that come out of that place are chocolates and sweets  they come out through a special trap door in the wall  all packed and addressed  and they are picked up every day by post office trucks  
 but grandpa  what sort of people are they that work in there  
 my dear boy   said grandpa joe   that is one of the great mysteries of the chocolate making world  we know only one thing about them  they are very small  the faint shadows that sometimes appear behind the windows  especially late at night when the lights are on  are those of tiny people  people no taller than my knee  
 there aren t any such people   charlie said 
just then  mr bucket  charlie s father  came into the room  he was home from the toothpaste factory  and he was waving an evening newspaper rather excitedly   have you heard the news   he cried  he held up the paper so that they could see the huge headline  the headline said 
wonka factory to be opened at last to lucky few
 
the golden tickets
 you mean people are actually going to be allowed to go inside the factory   cried grandpa
joe   read us what it says  quickly  
 all right   said mr bucket  smoothing out the newspaper   listen  
evening bulletin
mr willy wonka  the confectionery genius whom nobody has seen for the last ten years  sent out the following notice today

 signed willy wonka  

 the man s dotty   muttered grandma josephine 
 he s brilliant   cried grandpa joe   he s a magician  just imagine what will happen now  the whole world will be searching for those golden tickets  everyone will be buying wonka s chocolate bars in the hope of finding one  he ll sell more than ever before  oh  how exciting it would be to find one  
 and all the chocolate and sweets that you could eat for the rest of your life  free   said grandpa george   just imagine that  
 they d have to deliver them in a truck   said grandma georgina   it makes me quite ill to think of it   said grandma josephine 
 nonsense   cried grandpa joe   wouldn t it be something  charlie  to open a bar of chocolate and see a golden ticket glistening inside  
 it certainly would  grandpa  but there isn t a hope   charlie said sadly   i only get one bar a year  
 you never know  darling   said grandma georgina   it s your birthday next week  you have as much chance as anybody else  
 i m afraid that simply isn t true   said grandpa george   the kids who are going to find the golden tickets are the ones who can afford to buy bars of chocolate every day  our charlie gets only one a year  there isn t a hope  
 
the first two finders
the very next day  the first golden ticket was found  the finder was a boy called
augustus gloop  and mr bucket s evening newspaper carried a large picture of him on the
front page  the picture showed a nine year old boy who was so enormously fat he looked
as though he had been blown up with a powerful pump  great flabby folds of fat bulged out
from every part of his body  and his face was like a monstrous ball of dough with two small
greedy curranty eyes peering out upon the world  the town in which augustus gloop lived 
the newspaper said  had gone wild with excitement over their hero  flags were flying from
all the windows  children had been given a holiday from school  and a parade was being
organized in honour of the famous youth 
 i just knew augustus would find a golden ticket   his mother had told the newspapermen   he eats so many bars of chocolate a day that it was almost impossible for him not to find one  eating is his hobby  you know  that s all he s interested in  but still  that s better than being a hooligan and shooting off zip guns and things like that in his spare time  isn t it  and what i always say is  he wouldn t go on eating like he does unless he needed nourishment  would he  it s all vitamins  anyway  what a thrill it will be for him to visit mr wonka s marvellous factory  we re just as proud as anything  
 what a revolting woman   said grandma josephine   and what a repulsive boy   said grandma georgina   only four golden tickets left   said grandpa george   i wonder who ll get those  
and now the whole country  indeed  the whole world  seemed suddenly to be caught up in a mad chocolate buying spree  everybody searching frantically for those precious remaining tickets  fully grown women were seen going into sweet shops and buying ten wonka bars at a time  then tearing off the wrappers on the spot and peering eagerly underneath for a glint of golden paper  children were taking hammers and smashing their piggy banks and running out to the shops with handfuls of money  in one city  a famous gangster robbed a bank of a thousand pounds and spent the whole lot on wonka bars that same afternoon  and when the police entered his house to arrest him  they found him sitting on the floor amidst mountains of chocolate  ripping off the wrappers with the blade of a long dagger  in far off russia  a woman called charlotte russe claimed to have found the second ticket  but it turned out to be a clever fake  the famous english scientist  professor foulbody  invented a machine which would tell you at once  without opening the wrapper of a bar of chocolate  whether or not there was a golden ticket hidden underneath it  the machine had a mechanical arm that shot out with tremendous force and grabbed hold of anything that had the slightest bit of gold inside it  and for a moment  it looked like the answer to everything  but unfortunately  while the professor was showing off the machine to the public at the sweet counter of a large department store  the mechanical arm shot out and made a grab for the gold filling in the back tooth of a duchess who was standing near by  there was an ugly scene  and the machine was smashed by the crowd 
suddenly  on the day before charlie bucket s birthday  the newspapers announced that the second golden ticket had been found  the lucky person was a small girl called veruca salt who lived with her rich parents in a great city far away  once again mr bucket s evening newspaper carried a big picture of the finder  she was sitting between her beaming father and mother in the living room of their house  waving the golden ticket above her head  and grinning from ear to ear 
veruca s father  mr salt  had eagerly explained to the newspapermen exactly how the ticket was found   you see  boys   he had said   as soon as my little girl told me that she simply had to have one of those golden tickets  i went out into the town and started buying up all the wonka bars i could lay my hands on  thousands of them  i must have bought  hundreds of thousands  then i had them loaded on to trucks and sent directly to my own factory  i m in the peanut business  you see  and i ve got about a hundred women working for me over at my place  shelling peanuts for roasting and salting  that s what they do all day long  those women  they sit there shelling peanuts  so i says to them   okay  girls   i says   from now on  you can stop shelling peanuts and start shelling the wrappers off these chocolate bars instead   and they did  i had every worker in the place yanking the paper off those bars of chocolate full speed ahead from morning till night 
 but three days went by  and we had no luck  oh  it was terrible  my little veruca got more and more upset each day  and every time i went home she would scream at me   where s my golden ticket  i want my golden ticket   and she would lie for hours on the floor  kicking and yelling in the most disturbing way  well  i just hated to see my little girl feeling unhappy like that  so i vowed i would keep up the search until i d got her what she wanted  then suddenly  on the evening of the fourth day  one of my women workers yelled   i ve got it  a golden ticket   and i said   give it to me  quick   and she did  and i rushed it home and gave it to my darling veruca  and now she s all smiles  and we have a happy home once again  
 that s even worse than the fat boy   said grandma josephine 
 she needs a really good spanking   said grandma georgina 
 i don t think the girl s father played it quite fair  grandpa  do you   charlie murmured 
 he spoils her   grandpa joe said   and no good can ever come from spoiling a child like that  charlie  you mark my words  
 come to bed  my darling   said charlie s mother   tomorrow s your birthday  don t forget that  so i expect you ll be up early to open your present  
 a wonka chocolate bar   cried charlie   it is a wonka bar  isn t it  
 yes  my love   his mother said   of course it is  
 oh  wouldn t it be wonderful if i found the third golden ticket inside it   charlie said 
 bring it in here when you get it   grandpa joe said   then we can all watch you taking off the wrapper  
 
charlie s birthday
 happy birthday   cried the four old grandparents  as charlie came into their room early the
next morning 
charlie smiled nervously and sat down on the edge of the bed  he was holding his present  his only present  very carefully in his two hands  wonka s whipple scrumptious fudgemallow delight  it said on the wrapper 
the four old people  two at either end of the bed  propped themselves up on their pillows and stared with anxious eyes at the bar of chocolate in charlie s hands 
mr and mrs bucket came in and stood at the foot of the bed  watching charlie 
the room became silent  everybody was waiting now for charlie to start opening his present  charlie looked down at the bar of chocolate  he ran his fingers slowly back and forth along the length of it  stroking it lovingly  and the shiny paper wrapper made little sharp crackly noises in the quiet room 
then mrs bucket said gently   you mustn t be too disappointed  my darling  if you don t find what you re looking for underneath that wrapper  you really can t expect to be as lucky as all that  
 she s quite right   mr bucket said  charlie didn t say anything 
 after all   grandma josephine said   in the whole wide world there are only three tickets left to be found  
 the thing to remember   grandma georgina said   is that whatever happens  you ll still have the bar of chocolate  
 wonka s whipple scrumptious fudgemallow delight   cried grandpa george   it s the best of them all  you ll just love it  
 yes   charlie whispered   i know  
 just forget all about those golden tickets and enjoy the chocolate   grandpa joe said   why don t you do that  
they all knew it was ridiculous to expect this one poor little bar of chocolate to have a magic ticket inside it  and they were trying as gently and as kindly as they could to prepare charlie for the disappointment  but there was one other thing that the grown ups also knew  and it was this  that however small the chance might be of striking lucky  the chance was there 
the chance had to be there 
this particular bar of chocolate had as much chance as any other of having a golden ticket 
and that was why all the grandparents and parents in the room were actually just as tense and excited as charlie was  although they were pretending to be very calm 
 you d better go ahead and open it up  or you ll be late for school   grandpa joe said   you might as well get it over with   grandpa george said 
 open it  my dear   grandma georgina said   please open it  you re making me jumpy   very slowly  charlie s fingers began to tear open one small corner of the wrapping paper  the old people in the bed all leaned forward  craning their scraggy necks 
then suddenly  as though he couldn t bear the suspense any longer  charlie tore the wrapper right down the middle  and on to his lap  there fell   a light brown creamy coloured bar of chocolate 
there was no sign of a golden ticket anywhere 
 well  that s that   said grandpa joe brightly   it s just what we expected  
charlie looked up  four kind old faces were watching him intently from the bed  he smiled at them  a small sad smile  and then he shrugged his shoulders and picked up the chocolate bar and held it out to his mother  and said   here  mother  have a bit  we ll share it  i want everybody to taste it  
 certainly not   his mother said 
and the others all cried   no  no  we wouldn t dream of it  it s all yours  
 please   begged charlie  turning round and offering it to grandpa joe  but neither he nor anyone else would take even a tiny bit 
 it s time to go to school  my darling   mrs bucket said  putting an arm around charlie s skinny shoulders   come on  or you ll be late  
 
two more golden tickets found
that evening  mr bucket s newspaper announced the finding of not only the third golden
ticket  but the fourth as well  two golden tickets found today  screamed the
headlines  only one more left 
 all right   said grandpa joe  when the whole family was gathered in the old people s room after supper   let s hear who found them  
 the third ticket   read mr bucket  holding the newspaper up close to his face because his eyes were bad and he couldn t afford glasses   the third ticket was found by a miss violet beauregarde  there was great excitement in the beauregarde household when our reporter arrived to interview the lucky young lady  cameras were clicking and flashbulbs were flashing and people were pushing and jostling and trying to get a bit closer to the famous girl  and the famous girl was standing on a chair in the living room waving the golden ticket madly at arm s length as though she were flagging a taxi  she was talking very fast and very loudly to everyone  but it was not easy to hear all that she said because she was chewing so ferociously upon a piece of gum at the same time 
  i m a gum chewer  normally   she shouted   but when i heard about these ticket things of mr wonka s  i gave up gum and started on chocolate bars in the hope of striking lucky  now  of course  i m back on gum  i just adore gum  i can t do without it  i munch it all day long except for a few minutes at mealtimes when i take it out and stick it behind my ear for safekeeping  to tell you the truth  i simply wouldn t feel comfortable if i didn t have that little wedge of gum to chew on every moment of the day  i really wouldn t  my mother says it s not ladylike and it looks ugly to see a girl s jaws going up and down like mine do all the time  but i don t agree  and who s she to criticize  anyway  because if you ask me  i d say that her jaws are going up and down almost as much as mine are just from yelling at me every minute of the day  
  now  violet   mrs beauregarde said from a far corner of the room where she was standing on the piano to avoid being trampled by the mob 
  all right  mother  keep your hair on   miss beauregarde shouted   and now   she went on  turning to the reporters again   it may interest you to know that this piece of gum i m chewing right at this moment is one i ve been working on for over three months solid  that s a record  that is  it s beaten the record held by my best friend  miss cornelia prinzmetel  and was she furious  it s my most treasured possession now  this piece of gum is  at night time  i just stick it on the end of the bedpost  and it s as good as ever in the mornings  a bit hard at first  maybe  but it soon softens up again after i ve given it a few good chews  before i started chewing for the world record  i used to change my piece of gum once a day  i used to do it in our lift on the way home from school  why the lift  because i liked sticking the gooey piece that i d just finished with on to one of the control buttons  then the next person who came along and pressed the button got my old gum on the end of his or her finger  ha ha  and what a racket they kicked up  some of them  you get the best results with women who have expensive gloves on  oh yes  i m thrilled to be going to mr wonka s factory  and i understand that afterwards he s going to give me enough gum to last me for the rest of my whole life  whoopee  hooray   
 beastly girl   said grandma josephine 
 despicable   said grandma georgina   she ll come to a sticky end one day  chewing all that gum  you see if she doesn t  
 and who got the fourth golden ticket   charlie asked 
 now  let me see   said mr bucket  peering at the newspaper again   ah yes  here we are  the fourth golden ticket   he read   was found by a boy called mike teavee  
 another bad lot  i ll be bound   muttered grandma josephine   don t interrupt  grandma   said mrs bucket 
 the teavee household   said mr bucket  going on with his reading   was crammed  like all the others  with excited visitors when our reporter arrived  but young mike teavee  the lucky winner  seemed extremely annoyed by the whole business   can t you fools see i m watching television   he said angrily   i wish you wouldn t interrupt  
 the nine year old boy was seated before an enormous television set  with his eyes glued to the screen  and he was watching a film in which one bunch of gangsters was shooting up another bunch of gangsters with machine guns  mike teavee himself had no less than eighteen toy pistols of various sizes hanging from belts around his body  and every now and again he would leap up into the air and fire off half a dozen rounds from one or another of these weapons 
  quiet   he shouted  when someone tried to ask him a question   didn t i tell you not to interrupt  this show s an absolute whiz banger  it s terrific  i watch it every day  i watch all of them every day  even the rotten ones  where there s no shooting  i like the gangsters best  they re terrific  those gangsters  especially when they start pumping each other full of lead  or flashing the old stilettos  or giving each other the one two three with their knuckledusters  gosh  what wouldn t i give to be doing that myself  it s the life  i tell you  it s terrific   
 that s quite enough   snapped grandma josephine   i can t bear to listen to it  
 nor me   said grandma georgina   do all children behave like this nowadays  like these brats we ve been hearing about  
 of course not   said mr bucket  smiling at the old lady in the bed   some do  of course  in fact  quite a lot of them do  but not all  
 and now there s only one ticket left   said grandpa george 
 quite so   sniffed grandma georgina   and just as sure as i ll be having cabbage soup for supper tomorrow  that ticket ll go to some nasty little beast who doesn t deserve it  
 
grandpa joe takes a gamble
the next day  when charlie came home from school and went in to see his grandparents  he
found that only grandpa joe was awake  the other three were all snoring loudly 
 ssshh   whispered grandpa joe  and he beckoned charlie to come closer  charlie tiptoed over and stood beside the bed  the old man gave charlie a sly grin  and then he started rummaging under his pillow with one hand  and when the hand came out again  there was an ancient leather purse clutched in the fingers  under cover of the bedclothes  the old man opened the purse and tipped it upside down  out fell a single silver sixpence   it s my secret hoard   he whispered   the others don t know i ve got it  and now  you and i are going to have one more fling at finding that last ticket  how about it  eh  but you ll have to help me  
 are you sure you want to spend your money on that  grandpa   charlie whispered 
 of course i m sure   spluttered the old man excitedly   don t stand there arguing  i m as keen as you are to find that ticket  here  take the money and run down the street to the nearest shop and buy the first wonka bar you see and bring it straight back to me  and we ll open it together  
charlie took the little silver coin  and slipped quickly out of the room  in five minutes  he was back 
 have you got it   whispered grandpa joe  his eyes shining with excitement 
charlie nodded and held out the bar of chocolate  wonka s nutty crunch surprise  it said on the wrapper 
 good   the old man whispered  sitting up in the bed and rubbing his hands   now  come over here and sit close to me and we ll open it together  are you ready  
 yes   charlie said   i m ready  
 all right  you tear off the first bit  
 no   charlie said   you paid for it  you do it all  
the old man s fingers were trembling most terribly as they fumbled with the wrapper   we don t have a hope  really   he whispered  giggling a bit   you do know we don t have a hope  don t you  
 yes   charlie said   i know that  
they looked at each other  and both started giggling nervously 
 mind you   said grandpa joe   there is just that tiny chance that it might be the one  don t you agree  
 yes   charlie said   of course  why don t you open it  grandpa  
 all in good time  my boy  all in good time  which end do you think i ought to open first  
 that corner  the one furthest from you  just tear off a tiny bit  but not quite enough for us to see anything  
 like that   said the old man 
 yes  now a little bit more  
 you finish it   said grandpa joe   i m too nervous  
 no  grandpa  you must do it yourself
 very well  then  here goes   he tore off the wrapper 
they both stared at what lay underneath  it was a bar of chocolate  nothing more 
all at once  they both saw the funny side of the whole thing  and they burst into peals of laughter 
 what on earth s going on   cried grandma josephine  waking up suddenly   nothing   said grandpa joe   you go on back to sleep  
  
the family begins to starve
during the next two weeks  the weather turned very cold  first came the snow  it began very suddenly one morning just as charlie bucket was getting dressed for school  standing by the window  he saw the huge flakes drifting slowly down out of an icy sky that was the colour of steel 
by evening  it lay four feet deep around the tiny house  and mr bucket had to dig a path from the front door to the road 
after the snow  there came a freezing gale that blew for days and days without stopping  and oh  how bitter cold it was  everything that charlie touched seemed to be made of ice  and each time he stepped outside the door  the wind was like a knife on his cheek 
inside the house  little jets of freezing air came rushing in through the sides of the windows and under the doors  and there was no place to go to escape them  the four old ones lay silent and huddled in their bed  trying to keep the cold out of their bones  the excitement over the golden tickets had long since been forgotten  nobody in the family gave a thought now to anything except the two vital problems of trying to keep warm and trying to get enough to eat 
there is something about very cold weather that gives one an enormous appetite  most of us find ourselves beginning to crave rich steaming stews and hot apple pies and all kinds of delicious warming dishes  and because we are all a great deal luckier than we realize  we usually get what we want  or near enough  but charlie bucket never got what he wanted because the family couldn t afford it  and as the cold weather went on and on  he became ravenously and desperately hungry  both bars of chocolate  the birthday one and the one grandpa joe had bought  had long since been nibbled away  and all he got now were those thin  cabbagy meals three times a day 
then all at once  the meals became even thinner 
the reason for this was that the toothpaste factory  the place where mr bucket worked  suddenly went bust and had to close down  quickly  mr bucket tried to get another job  but he had no luck  in the end  the only way in which he managed to earn a few pennies was by shovelling snow in the streets  but it wasn t enough to buy even a quarter of the food that seven people needed  the situation became desperate  breakfast was a single slice of bread for each person now  and lunch was maybe half a boiled potato 
slowly but surely  everybody in the house began to starve 
and every day  little charlie bucket  trudging through the snow on his way to school  would have to pass mr willy wonka s giant chocolate factory  and every day  as he came near to it  he would lift his small pointed nose high in the air and sniff the wonderful sweet smell of melting chocolate  sometimes  he would stand motionless outside the gates for several minutes on end  taking deep swallowing breaths as though he were trying to eat the smell itself 
 that child   said grandpa joe  poking his head up from under the blanket one icy morning   that child has got to have more food  it doesn t matter about us  we re too old to bother with  but a growing boy  he can t go on like this  he s beginning to look like a skeleton  
 what can one do   murmured grandma josephine miserably   he refuses to take any of ours  i hear his mother tried to slip her own piece of bread on to his plate at breakfast this morning  but he wouldn t touch it  he made her take it back  
 he s a fine little fellow   said grandpa george   he deserves better than this   the cruel weather went on and on 
and every day  charlie bucket grew thinner and thinner  his face became frighteningly white and pinched  the skin was drawn so tightly over the cheeks that you could see the shapes of the bones underneath  it seemed doubtful whether he could go on much longer like this without becoming dangerously ill 
and now  very calmly  with that curious wisdom that seems to come so often to small children in times of hardship  he began to make little changes here and there in some of the things that he did  so as to save his strength  in the mornings  he left the house ten minutes earlier so that he could walk slowly to school  without ever having to run  he sat quietly in the classroom during break  resting himself  while the others rushed outdoors and threw snowballs and wrestled in the snow  everything he did now  he did slowly and carefully  to prevent exhaustion 
then one afternoon  walking back home with the icy wind in his face  and incidentally feeling hungrier than he had ever felt before   his eye was caught suddenly by something silvery lying in the gutter  in the snow  charlie stepped off the kerb and bent down to examine it  part of it was buried under the snow  but he saw at once what it was 
it was a fifty pence piece 
quickly he looked around him 
had somebody just dropped it 
no  that was impossible because of the way part of it was buried 
several people went hurrying past him on the pavement  their chins sunk deep in the collars of their coats  their feet crunching in the snow  none of them was searching for any money  none of them was taking the slightest notice of the small boy crouching in the gutter 
then was it his  this fifty pence  could he have it 
carefully  charlie pulled it out from under the snow  it was damp and dirty  but otherwise perfect 
a whole fifty pence 
he held it tightly between his shivering fingers  gazing down at it  it meant one thing to him at that moment  only one thing  it meant food 
automatically  charlie turned and began moving towards the nearest shop  it was only ten paces away  it was a newspaper and stationery shop  the kind that sells almost everything  including sweets and cigars   and what he would do  he whispered quickly to himself   he would buy one luscious bar of chocolate and eat it all up  every bit of it  right then and there   and the rest of the money he would take straight back home and give to his mother 
  
the miracle
charlie entered the shop and laid the damp fifty pence on the counter 
 one wonka s whipple scrumptious fudgemallow delight   he said  remembering how much he had loved the one he had on his birthday 
the man behind the counter looked fat and well fed  he had big lips and fat cheeks and a very fat neck  the fat around his neck bulged out all around the top of his collar like a rubber ring  he turned and reached behind him for the chocolate bar  then he turned back again and handed it to charlie  charlie grabbed it and quickly tore off the wrapper and took an enormous bite  then he took another  and another   and oh  the joy of being able to cram large pieces of something sweet and solid into one s mouth  the sheer blissful joy of being able to fill one s mouth with rich solid food 
 you look like you wanted that one  sonny   the shopkeeper said pleasantly  charlie nodded  his mouth bulging with chocolate 
the shopkeeper put charlie s change on the counter   take it easy   he said   it ll give you a tummy ache if you swallow it like that without chewing  
charlie went on wolfing the chocolate  he couldn t stop  and in less than half a minute  the whole thing had disappeared down his throat  he was quite out of breath  but he felt marvellously  extraordinarily happy  he reached out a hand to take the change  then he paused  his eyes were just above the level of the counter  they were staring at the silver coins lying there  the coins were all five penny pieces  there were nine of them altogether  surely it wouldn t matter if he spent just one more 
 i think   he said quietly   i think  i ll have just one more of those chocolate bars  the same kind as before  please  
 why not   the fat shopkeeper said  reaching behind him again and taking another whipple scrumptious fudgemallow delight from the shelf  he laid it on the counter 
charlie picked it up and tore off the wrapper  and suddenly   from underneath the wrapper   there came a brilliant flash of gold 
charlie s heart stood still 
 it s a golden ticket   screamed the shopkeeper  leaping about a foot in the air   you ve got a golden ticket  you ve found the last golden ticket  hey  would you believe it  come and look at this  everybody  the kid s found wonka s last golden ticket  there it is  it s right here in his hands  
it seemed as though the shopkeeper might be going to have a fit   in my shop  too   he yelled   he found it right here in my own little shop  somebody call the newspapers quick and let them know  watch out now  sonny  don t tear it as you unwrap it  that thing s precious  
in a few seconds  there was a crowd of about twenty people clustering around charlie  and many more were pushing their way in from the street  everybody wanted to get a look at the golden ticket and at the lucky finder 
 where is it   somebody shouted   hold it up so all of us can see it  
 there it is  there   someone else shouted   he s holding it in his hands  see the gold shining  
 how did he manage to find it  i d like to know   a large boy shouted angrily   twenty bars a day i ve been buying for weeks and weeks  
 think of all the free stuff he ll be getting too   another boy said enviously   a lifetime supply  
 he ll need it  the skinny little shrimp   a girl said  laughing 
charlie hadn t moved  he hadn t even unwrapped the golden ticket from around the chocolate  he was standing very still  holding it tightly with both hands while the crowd pushed and shouted all around him  he felt quite dizzy  there was a peculiar floating sensation coming over him  as though he were floating up in the air like a balloon  his feet didn t seem to be touching the ground at all  he could hear his heart thumping away loudly somewhere in his throat 
at that point  he became aware of a hand resting lightly on his shoulder  and when he looked up  he saw a tall man standing over him   listen   the man whispered   i ll buy it from you  i ll give you fifty pounds  how about it  eh  and i ll give you a new bicycle as well  okay  
 are you crazy   shouted a woman who was standing equally close   why  i d give him two hundred pounds for that ticket  you want to sell that ticket for two hundred pounds  young man  
 that s quite enough of that   the fat shopkeeper shouted  pushing his way through the crowd and taking charlie firmly by the arm   leave the kid alone  will you  make way there  let him out   and to charlie  as he led him to the door  he whispered   don t you let anybody have it  take it straight home  quickly  before you lose it  run all the way and don t stop till you get there  you understand  
charlie nodded 
 you know something   the fat shopkeeper said  pausing a moment and smiling at charlie   i have a feeling you needed a break like this  i m awfully glad you got it  good luck to you  sonny  
 thank you   charlie said  and off he went  running through the snow as fast as his legs would go  and as he flew past mr willy wonka s factory  he turned and waved at it and sang out   i ll be seeing you  i ll be seeing you soon   and five minutes later he arrived at his own home 
  
what it said on the golden ticket
charlie burst through the front door  shouting   mother  mother  mother  
mrs bucket was in the old grandparents  room  serving them their evening soup 
 mother   yelled charlie  rushing in on them like a hurricane   look  i ve got it  look  mother  look  the last golden ticket  it s mine  i found some money in the street and i bought two bars of chocolate and the second one had the golden ticket and there were crowds of people all around me wanting to see it and the shopkeeper rescued me and i ran all the way home and here i am  it s the fifth golden ticket  mother  and i ve found it  
mrs bucket simply stood and stared  while the four old grandparents  who were sitting up in bed balancing bowls of soup on their laps  all dropped their spoons with a clatter and froze against their pillows 
for about ten seconds there was absolute silence in the room  nobody dared to speak or move  it was a magic moment 
then  very softly  grandpa joe said   you re pulling our legs  charlie  aren t you  you re having a little joke  
 i am not   cried charlie  rushing up to the bed and holding out the large and beautiful golden ticket for him to see 
grandpa joe leaned forward and took a close look  his nose almost touching the ticket  the others watched him  waiting for the verdict 
then very slowly  with a slow and marvellous grin spreading all over his face  grandpa joe lifted his head and looked straight at charlie  the colour was rushing to his cheeks  and his eyes were wide open  shining with joy  and in the centre of each eye  right in the very centre  in the black pupil  a little spark of wild excitement was slowly dancing  then the old man took a deep breath  and suddenly  with no warning whatsoever  an explosion seemed to take place inside him  he threw up his arms and yelled  yippeeeeeeee   and at the same time  his long bony body rose up out of the bed and his bowl of soup went flying into the face of grandma josephine  and in one fantastic leap  this old fellow of ninety six and a half  who hadn t been out of bed these last twenty years  jumped on to the floor and started doing a dance of victory in his pyjamas 
 yippeeeeeeeeee   he shouted   three cheers for charlie  hip  hip  hooray  
at this point  the door opened  and mr bucket walked into the room  he was cold and tired  and he looked it  all day long  he had been shovelling snow in the streets 
 cripes   he cried   what s going on in here  
it didn t take them long to tell him what had happened 
 i don t believe it   he said   it s not possible  
 show him the ticket  charlie   shouted grandpa joe  who was still dancing around the floor like a dervish in his striped pyjamas   show your father the fifth and last golden ticket in the world  
 let me see it  charlie   mr bucket said  collapsing into a chair and holding out his hand  charlie came forward with the precious document 
it was a very beautiful thing  this golden ticket  having been made  so it seemed  from a sheet of pure gold hammered out almost to the thinness of paper  on one side of it  printed by some clever method in jet black letters  was the invitation itself  from mr wonka 
 read it aloud   said grandpa joe  climbing back into bed again at last   let s all hear exactly what it says  
mr bucket held the lovely golden ticket up close to his eyes  his hands were trembling slightly  and he seemed to be overcome by the whole business  he took several deep breaths  then he cleared his throat  and said   all right  i ll read it  here we go

 signed  willy wonka  
 the first day of february   cried mrs bucket   but that s tomorrow  today is the last day of january  i know it is  
 cripes   said mr bucket   i think you re right  
 you re just in time   shouted grandpa joe   there s not a moment to lose  you must start making preparations at once  wash your face  comb your hair  scrub your hands  brush your teeth  blow your nose  cut your nails  polish your shoes  iron your shirt  and for heaven s sake  get all that mud off your pants  you must get ready  my boy  you must get ready for the biggest day of your life  
 now don t over excite yourself  grandpa   mrs bucket said   and don t fluster poor charlie 
we must all try to keep very calm  now the first thing to decide is this  who is going to go with charlie to the factory  
 i will   shouted grandpa joe  leaping out of bed once again   i ll take him  i ll look after him  you leave it to me  
mrs bucket smiled at the old man  then she turned to her husband and said   how about you  dear  don t you think you ought to go  
 well   mr bucket said  pausing to think about it   no   i m not so sure that i should    but you must  
 there s no must about it  my dear   mr bucket said gently   mind you  i d love to go  it ll be tremendously exciting  but on the other hand  i believe that the person who really deserves to go most of all is grandpa joe himself  he seems to know more about it than we do  provided  of course  that he feels well enough   
 yippeeeeee   shouted grandpa joe  seizing charlie by the hands and dancing round the room 
 he certainly seems well enough   mrs bucket said  laughing   yes  perhaps you re right after all  perhaps grandpa joe should be the one to go with him  i certainly can t go myself and leave the other three old people all alone in bed for a whole day  
 hallelujah   yelled grandpa joe   praise the lord  
at that point  there came a loud knock on the front door  mr bucket went to open it  and the next moment  swarms of newspapermen and photographers were pouring into the house  they had tracked down the finder of the fifth golden ticket  and now they all wanted to get the full story for the front pages of the morning papers  for several hours  there was complete pandemonium in the little house  and it must have been nearly midnight before mr bucket was able to get rid of them so that charlie could go to bed 
  
the big day arrives
the sun was shining brightly on the morning of the big day  but the ground was still white
with snow and the air was very cold 
outside the gates of wonka s factory  enormous crowds of people had gathered to watch the five lucky ticket holders going in  the excitement was tremendous  it was just before ten o clock  the crowds were pushing and shouting  and policemen with arms linked were trying to hold them back from the gates 
right beside the gates  in a small group that was carefully shielded from the crowds by the police  stood the five famous children  together with the grown ups who had come with them 
the tall bony figure of grandpa joe could be seen standing quietly among them  and beside him  holding tightly on to his hand  was little charlie bucket himself 
all the children  except charlie  had both their mothers and fathers with them  and it was a good thing that they had  otherwise the whole party might have got out of hand  they were so eager to get going that their parents were having to hold them back by force to prevent them from climbing over the gates   be patient   cried the fathers   be still  it s not time yet  it s not ten o clock  
behind him  charlie bucket could hear the shouts of the people in the crowd as they pushed and fought to get a glimpse of the famous children 
 there s violet beauregarde   he heard someone shouting   that s her all right  i can remember her face from the newspapers  
 and you know what   somebody else shouted back   she s still chewing that dreadful old piece of gum she s had for three months  you look at her jaws  they re still working on it  
 who s the big fat boy  
 that s augustus gloop  
 so it is  
 enormous  isn t he  
 fantastic  
 who s the kid with a picture of the lone ranger stencilled on his windcheater  
 that s mike teavee  he s the television fiend  
 he must be crazy  look at all those toy pistols he s got hanging all over him  
 the one i want to see is veruca salt   shouted another voice in the crowd   she s the girl whose father bought up half a million chocolate bars and then made the workers in his peanut factory unwrap every one of them until they found a golden ticket  he gives her anything she wants  absolutely anything  she only has to start screaming for it and she gets it  
 dreadful  isn t it  
 shocking  i call it  
 which do you think is her  
 that one  over there on the left  the little girl in the silver mink coat  
 which one is charlie bucket  
 charlie bucket  he must be that skinny little shrimp standing beside the old fellow who looks like a skeleton  very close to us  just there  see him  
 why hasn t he got a coat on in this cold weather    don t ask me  maybe he can t afford to buy one    goodness me  he must be freezing  
charlie  standing only a few paces away from the speaker  gave grandpa joe s hand a squeeze  and the old man looked down at charlie and smiled 
somewhere in the distance  a church clock began striking ten 
very slowly  with a loud creaking of rusty hinges  the great iron gates of the factory began to swing open 
the crowd became suddenly silent  the children stopped jumping about  all eyes were fixed upon the gates 
 there he is   somebody shouted   that s him   and so it was 
  
mr willy wonka
mr wonka was standing all alone just inside the open gates of the factory 
and what an extraordinary little man he was 
he had a black top hat on his head 
he wore a tail coat made of a beautiful plum coloured velvet 
his trousers were bottle green 
his gloves were pearly grey 
and in one hand he carried a fine gold topped walking cane 
covering his chin  there was a small  neat  pointed black beard  a goatee  and his eyes   his eyes were most marvellously bright  they seemed to be sparkling and twinkling at you all the time  the whole face  in fact  was alight with fun and laughter 
and oh  how clever he looked  how quick and sharp and full of life  he kept making quick jerky little movements with his head  cocking it this way and that  and taking everything in with those bright twinkling eyes  he was like a squirrel in the quickness of his movements  like a quick clever old squirrel from the park 
suddenly  he did a funny little skipping dance in the snow  and he spread his arms wide  and he smiled at the five children who were clustered near the gates  and he called out   welcome  my little friends  welcome to the factory  
his voice was high and flutey   will you come forward one at a time  please   he called out   and bring your parents  then show me your golden ticket and give me your name  who s first  
the big fat boy stepped up   i m augustus gloop   he said 
 augustus   cried mr wonka  seizing his hand and pumping it up and down with terrific force   my dear boy  how good to see you  delighted  charmed  overjoyed to have you with us  and these are your parents  how nice  come in  come in  that s right  step through the gates  
mr wonka was clearly just as excited as everybody else   my name   said the next child to go forward   is veruca salt  
 my dear veruca  how do you do  what a pleasure this is  you do have an interesting name  don t you  i always thought that a veruca was a sort of wart that you got on the sole of your foot  but i must be wrong  mustn t i  how pretty you look in that lovely mink coat  i m so glad you could come  dear me  this is going to be such an exciting day  i do hope you enjoy it  i m sure you will  i know you will  your father  how are you  mr salt  and mrs salt  overjoyed to see you  yes  the ticket is quite in order  please go in  
the next two children  violet beauregarde and mike teavee  came forward to have their tickets examined and then to have their arms practically pumped off their shoulders by the energetic mr wonka 
and last of all  a small nervous voice whispered   charlie bucket  
 charlie   cried mr wonka   well  well  well  so there you are  you re the one who found your ticket only yesterday  aren t you  yes  yes  i read all about it in this morning s papers  just in time  my dear boy  i m so glad  so happy for you  and this  your grandfather  delighted to meet you  sir  overjoyed  enraptured  enchanted  all right  excellent  is everybody in now  five children  yes  good  now will you please follow me  our tour is about to begin  but do keep together  please don t wander off by yourselves  i shouldn t like to lose any of you at this stage of the proceedings  oh  dear me  no  
charlie glanced back over his shoulder and saw the great iron entrance gates slowly closing behind him  the crowds on the outside were still pushing and shouting  charlie took a last look at them  then  as the gates closed with a clang  all sight of the outside world disappeared 
 here we are   cried mr wonka  trotting along in front of the group   through this big red door  please  that s right  it s nice and warm inside  i have to keep it warm inside the factory because of the workers  my workers are used to an extremely hot climate  they can t stand the cold  they d perish if they went outdoors in this weather  they d freeze to death  
 but who are these workers   asked augustus gloop 
 all in good time  my dear boy   said mr wonka  smiling at augustus   be patient  you shall see everything as we go along  are all of you inside  good  would you mind closing the door  thank you  
charlie bucket found himself standing in a long corridor that stretched away in front of him as far as he could see  the corridor was so wide that a car could easily have been driven along it  the walls were pale pink  the lighting was soft and pleasant 
 how lovely and warm   whispered charlie 
 i know  and what a marvellous smell   answered grandpa joe  taking a long deep sniff  all the most wonderful smells in the world seemed to be mixed up in the air around them  the smell of roasting coffee and burnt sugar and melting chocolate and mint and violets and crushed hazelnuts and apple blossom and caramel and lemon peel  
and far away in the distance  from the heart of the great factory  came a muffled roar of energy as though some monstrous gigantic machine were spinning its wheels at breakneck speed 
 now this  my dear children   said mr wonka  raising his voice above the noise   this is the main corridor  will you please hang your coats and hats on those pegs over there  and then follow me  that s the way  good  everyone ready  come on  then  here we go   he trotted off rapidly down the corridor with the tails of his plum coloured velvet coat flapping behind him  and the visitors all hurried after him 
it was quite a large party of people  when you came to think of it  there were nine grown ups and five children  fourteen in all  so you can imagine that there was a good deal of pushing and shoving as they hustled and bustled down the passage  trying to keep up with the swift little figure in front of them   come on   cried mr wonka   get a move on  please  we ll never get round today if you dawdle like this  
soon  he turned right off the main corridor into another slightly narrower passage 
then he turned left 
then left again 
then right 
then left 
then right 
then right 
then left 
the place was like a gigantic rabbit warren  with passages leading this way and that in every direction 
 don t you let go my hand  charlie   whispered grandpa joe 
 notice how all these passages are sloping downwards   called out mr wonka   we are now going underground  all the most important rooms in my factory are deep down below the surface  
 why is that   somebody asked 
 there wouldn t be nearly enough space for them up on top   answered mr wonka   these rooms we are going to see are enormous  they re larger than football fields  no building in the world would be big enough to house them  but down here  underneath the ground  i ve got all the space i want  there s no limit  so long as i hollow it out  
mr wonka turned right 
he turned left 
he turned right again 
the passages were sloping steeper and steeper downhill now 
then suddenly  mr wonka stopped  in front of him  there was a shiny metal door  the party crowded round  on the door  in large letters  it said 
the chocolate room
  
the chocolate room
 an important room  this   cried mr wonka  taking a bunch of keys from his pocket and
slipping one into the keyhole of the door   this is the nerve centre of the whole factory  the
heart of the whole business  and so beautiful  i insist upon my rooms being beautiful  i
can t abide ugliness in factories  in we go  then  but do be careful  my dear children  don t
lose your heads  don t get over excited  keep very calm  
mr wonka opened the door  five children and nine grown ups pushed their ways in  and oh  what an amazing sight it was that now met their eyes 
they were looking down upon a lovely valley  there were green meadows on either side of the valley  and along the bottom of it there flowed a great brown river 
what is more  there was a tremendous waterfall halfway along the river  a steep cliff over which the water curled and rolled in a solid sheet  and then went crashing down into a boiling churning whirlpool of froth and spray 
below the waterfall  and this was the most astonishing sight of all   a whole mass of enormous glass pipes were dangling down into the river from somewhere high up in the ceiling  they really were enormous  those pipes  there must have been a dozen of them at least  and they were sucking up the brownish muddy water from the river and carrying it away to goodness knows where  and because they were made of glass  you could see the liquid flowing and bubbling along inside them  and above the noise of the waterfall  you could hear the never ending suck suck sucking sound of the pipes as they did their work 
graceful trees and bushes were growing along the riverbanks  weeping willows and alders and tall clumps of rhododendrons with their pink and red and mauve blossoms  in the meadows there were thousands of buttercups 
 there   cried mr wonka  dancing up and down and pointing his gold topped cane at the great brown river   it s all chocolate  every drop of that river is hot melted chocolate of the finest quality  the very finest quality  there s enough chocolate in there to fill every bathtub in the entire country  and all the swimming pools as well  isn t it terrific  and just look at my pipes  they suck up the chocolate and carry it away to all the other rooms in the factory where it is needed  thousands of gallons an hour  my dear children  thousands and thousands of gallons  
the children and their parents were too flabbergasted to speak  they were staggered  they were dumbfounded  they were bewildered and dazzled  they were completely bowled over by the hugeness of the whole thing  they simply stood and stared 
 the waterfall is most important   mr wonka went on   it mixes the chocolate  it churns it up  it pounds it and beats it  it makes it light and frothy  no other factory in the world mixes its chocolate by waterfall  but it s the only way to do it properly  the only way  and do you like my trees   he cried  pointing with his stick   and my lovely bushes  don t you think they look pretty  i told you i hated ugliness  and of course they are all eatable  all made of something different and delicious  and do you like my meadows  do you like my grass and my buttercups  the grass you are standing on  my dear little ones  is made of a new kind of soft  minty sugar that i ve just invented  i call it swudge  try a blade  please do  it s delectable  
automatically  everybody bent down and picked one blade of grass  everybody  that is  except augustus gloop  who took a big handful 
and violet beauregarde  before tasting her blade of grass  took the piece of world record breaking chewing gum out of her mouth and stuck it carefully behind her ear 
 isn t it wonderful   whispered charlie   hasn t it got a wonderful taste  grandpa  
 i could eat the whole field   said grandpa joe  grinning with delight   i could go around on all fours like a cow and eat every blade of grass in the field  
 try a buttercup   cried mr wonka   they re even nicer  
suddenly  the air was filled with screams of excitement  the screams came from veruca salt  she was pointing frantically to the other side of the river   look  look over there   she screamed   what is it  he s moving  he s walking  it s a little person  it s a little man  down there below the waterfall  
everybody stopped picking buttercups and stared across the river 
 she s right  grandpa   cried charlie   it is a little man  can you see him  
 i see him  charlie   said grandpa joe excitedly 
and now everybody started shouting at once 
 there s two of them  
 my gosh  so there is  
 there s more than two  there s one  two  three  four  five  
 what are they doing  
 where do they come from  
 who are they  
children and parents alike rushed down to the edge of the river to get a closer look 
 aren t they fantastic  
 no higher than my knee  
 look at their funny long hair  
the tiny men  they were no larger than medium sized dolls   had stopped what they were doing  and now they were staring back across the river at the visitors  one of them pointed towards the children  and then he whispered something to the other four  and all five of them burst into peals of laughter 
 but they can t be real people   charlie said 
 of course they re real people   mr wonka answered   they re oompa loompas  
  
the oompa loompas
 oompa loompas   everyone said at once   oompa loompas  
 imported direct from loompaland   said mr wonka proudly 
 there s no such place   said mrs salt 
 excuse me  dear lady  but  
 mr wonka   cried mrs salt   i m a teacher of geography
 then you ll know all about it   said mr wonka   and oh  what a terrible country it is  nothing but thick jungles infested by the most dangerous beasts in the world  hornswogglers and snozzwangers and those terrible wicked whangdoodles  a whangdoodle would eat ten oompa loompas for breakfast and come galloping back for a second helping  when i went out there  i found the little oompa loompas living in tree houses  they had to live in tree houses to escape from the whangdoodles and the hornswogglers and the snozzwangers  and they were living on green caterpillars  and the caterpillars tasted revolting  and the oompa loompas spent every moment of their days climbing through the treetops looking for other things to mash up with the caterpillars to make them taste better   red beetles  for instance  and eucalyptus leaves  and the bark of the bong bong tree  all of them beastly  but not quite so beastly as the caterpillars  poor little oompa loompas  the one food that they longed for more than any other was the cacao bean  but they couldn t get it an oompa loompa was lucky if he found three or four cacao beans a year  but oh  how they craved them  they used to dream about cacao beans all night and talk about them all day  you had only to mention the word  cacao  to an oompa loompa and he would start dribbling at the mouth  the cacao bean   mr wonka continued   which grows on the cacao tree  happens to be the thing from which all chocolate is made  you cannot make chocolate without the cacao bean  the cacao bean is chocolate  i myself use billions of cacao beans every week in this factory  and so  my dear children  as soon as i discovered that the oompa loompas were crazy about this particular food  i climbed up to their tree house village and poked my head in through the door of the tree house belonging to the leader of the tribe  the poor little fellow  looking thin and starved  was sitting there trying to eat a bowl full of mashed up green caterpillars without being sick   look here   i said  speaking not in english  of course  but in oompa loompish    look here  if you and all your people will come back to my country and live in my factory  you can have all the cacao beans you want  i ve got mountains of them in my storehouses  you can have cacao beans for every meal  you can gorge yourselves silly on them  i ll even pay your wages in cacao beans if you wish  
  you really mean it   asked the oompa loompa leader  leaping up from his chair 
  of course i mean it   i said   and you can have chocolate as well  chocolate tastes even better than cacao beans because it s got milk and sugar added  
 the little man gave a great whoop of joy and threw his bowl of mashed caterpillars right out of the tree house window   it s a deal   he cried   come on  let s go  
 so i shipped them all over here  every man  woman  and child in the oompa loompa tribe  it was easy  i smuggled them over in large packing cases with holes in them  and they all got here safely  they are wonderful workers  they all speak english now  they love dancing and music  they are always making up songs  i expect you will hear a good deal of singing today from time to time  i must warn you  though  that they are rather mischievous  they like jokes  they still wear the same kind of clothes they wore in the jungle  they insist upon that  the men  as you can see for yourselves across the river  wear only deerskins  the women wear leaves  and the children wear nothing at all  the women use fresh leaves every day  
 daddy   shouted veruca salt  the girl who got everything she wanted    daddy  i want an oompa loompa  i want you to get me an oompa loompa  i want an oompa loompa right away  i want to take it home with me  go on  daddy  get me an oompa loompa  
 now  now  my pet   her father said to her   we mustn t interrupt mr wonka    but i want an oompa loompa   screamed veruca 
 all right  veruca  all right  but i can t get it for you this second  please be patient  i ll see you have one before the day is out  
 augustus   shouted mrs gloop   augustus  sweetheart  i don t think you had better do that   augustus gloop  as you might have guessed  had quietly sneaked down to the edge of the river  and he was now kneeling on the riverbank  scooping hot melted chocolate into his mouth as fast as he could 
  
augustus gloop goes up the pipe
when mr wonka turned round and saw what augustus gloop was doing  he cried out   oh 
no  please  augustus  please  i beg of you not to do that  my chocolate must be untouched
by human hands  
 augustus   called out mrs gloop   didn t you hear what the man said  come away from that river at once  
 this stuff is fabulous   said augustus  taking not the slightest notice of his mother or mr wonka   gosh  i need a bucket to drink it properly  
 augustus   cried mr wonka  hopping up and down and waggling his stick in the air   you must come away  you are dirtying my chocolate  
 augustus   cried mrs gloop   augustus   cried mr gloop 
but augustus was deaf to everything except the call of his enormous stomach  he was now lying full length on the ground with his head far out over the river  lapping up the chocolate like a dog 
 augustus   shouted mrs gloop   you ll be giving that nasty cold of yours to about a million people all over the country  
 be careful  augustus   shouted mr gloop   you re leaning too far out  
mr gloop was absolutely right  for suddenly there was a shriek  and then a splash  and into the river went augustus gloop  and in one second he had disappeared under the brown surface 
 save him   screamed mrs gloop  going white in the face  and waving her umbrella about   he ll drown  he can t swim a yard  save him  save him  
 good heavens  woman   said mr gloop   i m not diving in there  i ve got my best suit on  
augustus gloop s face came up again to the surface  painted brown with chocolate   help  help  help   he yelled   fish me out  
 don t just stand there   mrs gloop screamed at mr gloop   do something  
 i am doing something   said mr gloop  who was now taking off his jacket and getting ready to dive into the chocolate  but while he was doing this  the wretched boy was being sucked closer and closer towards the mouth of one of the great pipes that was dangling down into the river  then all at once  the powerful suction took hold of him completely  and he was pulled under the surface and then into the mouth of the pipe 
the crowd on the riverbank waited breathlessly to see where he would come out   there he goes   somebody shouted  pointing upwards 
and sure enough  because the pipe was made of glass  augustus gloop could be clearly seen shooting up inside it  head first  like a torpedo 
 help  murder  police   screamed mrs gloop   augustus  come back at once  where are you going  
 it s a wonder to me   said mr gloop   how that pipe is big enough for him to go through it  
 it isn t big enough   said charlie bucket   oh dear  look  he s slowing down  
 so he is   said grandpa joe 
 he s going to stick   said charlie 
 i think he is   said grandpa joe 
 by golly  he has stuck   said charlie 
 it s his stomach that s done it   said mr gloop 
 he s blocked the whole pipe   said grandpa joe 
 smash the pipe   yelled mrs gloop  still waving her umbrella   augustus  come out of there at once  
the watchers below could see the chocolate swishing around the boy in the pipe  and they could see it building up behind him in a solid mass  pushing against the blockage  the pressure was terrific  something had to give  something did give  and that something was augustus  whoof  up he shot again like a bullet in the barrel of a gun 
 he s disappeared   yelled mrs gloop   where does that pipe go to  quick  call the fire brigade  
 keep calm   cried mr wonka   keep calm  my dear lady  keep calm  there is no danger  no danger whatsoever  augustus has gone on a little journey  that s all  a most interesting little journey  but he ll come out of it just fine  you wait and see  
 how can he possibly come out just fine   snapped mrs gloop   he ll be made into marshmallows in five seconds  
 impossible   cried mr wonka   unthinkable  inconceivable  absurd  he could never be made into marshmallows  
 and why not  may i ask   shouted mrs gloop 
 because that pipe doesn t go anywhere near it  that pipe  the one augustus went up   happens to lead directly to the room where i make a most delicious kind of strawberry flavoured chocolate coated fudge   
 then he ll be made into strawberry flavoured chocolate coated fudge   screamed mrs gloop   my poor augustus  they ll be selling him by the pound all over the country tomorrow morning  
 quite right   said mr gloop 
 i know i m right   said mrs gloop 
 it s beyond a joke   said mr gloop 
 mr wonka doesn t seem to think so   cried mrs gloop   just look at him  he s laughing his head off  how dare you laugh like that when my boy s just gone up the pipe  you monster   she shrieked  pointing her umbrella at mr wonka as though she were going to run him through   you think it s a joke  do you  you think that sucking my boy up into your fudge room like that is just one great big colossal joke  
 he ll be perfectly safe   said mr wonka  giggling slightly 
 he ll be chocolate fudge   shrieked mrs gloop 
 never   cried mr wonka 
 of course he will   shrieked mrs gloop 
 i wouldn t allow it   cried mr wonka 
 and why not   shrieked mrs gloop 
 because the taste would be terrible   said mr wonka   just imagine it  augustus flavoured chocolate coated gloop  no one would buy it  
 they most certainly would   cried mr gloop indignantly   i don t want to think about it   shrieked mrs gloop 
 nor do i   said mr wonka   and i do promise you  madam  that your darling boy is perfectly safe  
 if he s perfectly safe  then where is he   snapped mrs gloop   lead me to him this instant  
mr wonka turned around and clicked his fingers sharply  click  click  click  three times  immediately  an oompa loompa appeared  as if from nowhere  and stood beside him 
the oompa loompa bowed and smiled  showing beautiful white teeth  his skin was rosy white  his long hair was golden brown  and the top of his head came just above the height of mr wonka s knee  he wore the usual deerskin slung over his shoulder 
 now listen to me   said mr wonka  looking down at the tiny man   i want you to take mr and mrs gloop up to the fudge room and help them to find their son  augustus  he s just gone up the pipe  
the oompa loompa took one look at mrs gloop and exploded into peals of laughter 
 oh  do be quiet   said mr wonka   control yourself  pull yourself together  mrs gloop doesn t think it s at all funny  
 you can say that again   said mrs gloop 
 go straight to the fudge room   mr wonka said to the oompa loompa   and when you get there  take a long stick and start poking around inside the big chocolate mixing barrel  i m almost certain you ll find him in there  but you d better look sharp  you ll have to hurry  if you leave him in the chocolate mixing barrel too long  he s liable to get poured out into the fudge boiler  and that really would be a disaster  wouldn t it  my fudge would become quite uneatable  
mrs gloop let out a shriek of fury 
 i m joking   said mr wonka  giggling madly behind his beard   i didn t mean it  forgive me  i m so sorry  good bye  mrs gloop  and mr gloop  good bye  i ll see you later  
as mr and mrs gloop and their tiny escort hurried away  the five oompa loompas on the far side of the river suddenly began hopping and dancing about and beating wildly upon a number of very small drums   augustus gloop   they chanted   augustus gloop  augustus gloop  augustus gloop  
 grandpa   cried charlie   listen to them  grandpa  what are they doing  
 ssshh   whispered grandpa joe   i think they re going to sing us a song  
 augustus gloop   chanted the oompa loompas  augustus gloop  augustus gloop the great big greedy nincompoop how long could we allow this beastto gorge and guzzle  feed and feaston everything he wanted to great scott  it simply wouldn t do however long this pig might live we re positive he d never giveeven the smallest bit of funor happiness to anyone so what we do in cases suchas this  we use the gentle touch and carefully we take the bratand turn him into something thatwill give great pleasure to us all a doll  for instance  or a ball or marbles or a rocking horse but this revolting boy  of course was so unutterably vile so greedy  foul  and infantile he left a most disgusting tasteinside our mouths  and so in hastewe chose a thing that  come what may would take the nasty taste away  come on   we cried   the time is ripeto send him shooting up the pipe he has to go  it has to be  and very soon  he s going to seeinside the room to which he s gonesome funny things are going on but don t  dear children  be alarmed augustus gloop will not be harmed although  of course  we must admithe will be altered quite a bit he ll be quite changed from what he s been when he goes through the fudge machine slowly  the wheels go round and round the cogs begin to grind and pound a hundred knives go slice  slice  slice we add some sugar  cream  and spice we boil him for a minute more until we re absolutely surethat all the greed and all the gallis boiled away for once and all then out he comes  and now  by grace a miracle has taken place this boy  who only just beforewas loathed by men from shore to shore this greedy brute  this louse s ear is loved by people everywhere for who could hate or bear a grudgeagainst a luscious bit of fudge  
 i told you they loved singing   cried mr wonka   aren t they delightful  aren t they charming  but you mustn t believe a word they said  it s all nonsense  every bit of it  
 are the oompa loompas really joking  grandpa   asked charlie 
 of course they re joking   answered grandpa joe   they must be joking  at least  i hope they re joking  don t you  
  
down the chocolate river
 off we go   cried mr wonka   hurry up  everybody  follow me to the next room  and
please don t worry about augustus gloop  he s bound to come out in the wash  they
always do  we shall have to make the next part of the journey by boat  here she comes 
look  
a steamy mist was rising up now from the great warm chocolate river  and out of the mist there appeared suddenly a most fantastic pink boat  it was a large open row boat with a tall front and a tall back  like a viking boat of old   and it was of such a shining sparkling glistening pink colour that the whole thing looked as though it were made of bright  pink glass  there were many oars on either side of it  and as the boat came closer  the watchers on the riverbank could see that the oars were being pulled by masses of oompa loompas  at least ten of them to each oar 
 this is my private yacht   cried mr wonka  beaming with pleasure   i made her by hollowing out an enormous boiled sweet  isn t she beautiful  see how she comes cutting through the river  
the gleaming pink boiled sweet boat glided up to the riverbank  one hundred oompa loompas rested on their oars and stared up at the visitors  then suddenly  for some reason best known to themselves  they all burst into shrieks of laughter 
 what s so funny   asked violet beauregarde 
 oh  don t worry about them   cried mr wonka   they re always laughing  they think everything s a colossal joke  jump into the boat  all of you  come on  hurry up  
as soon as everyone was safely in  the oompa loompas pushed the boat away from the bank and began to row swiftly downriver 
 hey  there  mike teavee   shouted mr wonka   please do not lick the boat with your tongue  it ll only make it sticky  
 daddy   said veruca salt   i want a boat like this  i want you to buy me a big pink boiled sweet boat exactly like mr wonka s  and i want lots of oompa loompas to row me about  and i want a chocolate river and i want  i want   
 she wants a good kick in the pants   whispered grandpa joe to charlie  the old man was sitting in the back of the boat and little charlie bucket was right beside him  charlie was holding tightly on to his grandfather s bony old hand  he was in a whirl of excitement  everything that he had seen so far  the great chocolate river  the waterfall  the huge sucking pipes  the minty sugar meadows  the oompa loompas  the beautiful pink boat  and most of all  mr willy wonka himself   had been so astonishing that he began to wonder whether there could possibly be any more astonishments left  where were they going now  what were they going to see  and what in the world was going to happen in the next room 
 isn t it marvellous   said grandpa joe  grinning at charlie  charlie nodded and smiled up at the old man 
suddenly  mr wonka  who was sitting on charlie s other side  reached down into the bottom of the boat  picked up a large mug  dipped it into the river  filled it with chocolate  and handed it to charlie   drink this   he said   it ll do you good  you look starved to death  
then mr wonka filled a second mug and gave it to grandpa joe   you  too   he said   you look like a skeleton  what s the matter  hasn t there been anything to eat in your house lately  
 not much   said grandpa joe 
charlie put the mug to his lips  and as the rich warm creamy chocolate ran down his throat into his empty tummy  his whole body from head to toe began to tingle with pleasure  and a feeling of intense happiness spread over him 
 you like it   asked mr wonka 
 oh  it s wonderful   charlie said 
 the creamiest loveliest chocolate i ve ever tasted   said grandpa joe  smacking his lips 
 that s because it s been mixed by waterfall   mr wonka told him 
the boat sped on down the river  the river was getting narrower  there was some kind of a dark tunnel ahead  a great round tunnel that looked like an enormous pipe   and the river was running right into the tunnel  and so was the b oat   row on   shouted mr wonka  jumping up and waving his stick in the air   full speed ahead   and with the oompa loompas rowing faster than ever  the boat shot into the pitch dark tunnel  and all the passengers screamed with excitement 
 how can they see where they re going   shrieked violet beauregarde in the darkness   there s no knowing where they re going   cried mr wonka  hooting with laughter  there s no earthly way of knowingwhich direction they are going there s no knowing where they re rowing or which way the river s flowing not a speck of light is showing so the danger must be growing for the rowers keep on rowing and they re certainly not showingany signs that they are slowing  
 he s gone off his rocker   shouted one of the fathers  aghast  and the other parents joined in the chorus of frightened shouting   he s crazy   they shouted 
 he s balmy    he s nutty    he s screwy    he s batty  
 he s dippy  
 he s dotty  
 he s daffy  
 he s goofy  
 he s beany  
 he s buggy  
 he s wacky  
 he s loony  
 no  he is not   said grandpa joe 
 switch on the lights   shouted mr wonka  and suddenly  on came the lights and the whole tunnel was brilliantly lit up  and charlie could see that they were indeed inside a gigantic pipe  and the great upward curving walls of the pipe were pure white and spotlessly clean  the river of chocolate was flowing very fast inside the pipe  and the oompa loompas were all rowing like mad  and the boat was rocketing along at a furious pace  mr wonka was jumping up and down in the back of the boat and calling to the rowers to row faster and faster still  he seemed to love the sensation of whizzing through a white tunnel in a pink boat on a chocolate river  and he clapped his hands and laughed and kept glancing at his passengers to see if they were enjoying it as much as he 
 look  grandpa   cried charlie   there s a door in the wall   it was a green door and it was set into the wall of the tunnel just above the level of the river  as they flashed past it there was just enough time to read the writing on the door storeroom number     it said all the creams  dairy cream  whipped cream  violet cream  coffee cream  pineapple cream  vanilla cream  and hair cream 
 hair cream   cried mike teavee   you don t use hair cream  
 row on   shouted mr wonka   there s no time to answer silly questions  
they streaked past a black door storeroom number     it said on it whips  all shapes and sizes 
 whips   cried veruca salt   what on earth do you use whips for  
 for whipping cream  of course   said mr wonka   how can you whip cream without whips  whipped cream isn t whipped cream at all unless it s been whipped with whips  just as a poached egg isn t a poached egg unless it s been stolen from the woods in the dead of night 
row on  please  
they passed a yellow door on which it said storeroom number     all the beans  cacao beans  coffee beans  jelly beans  and has beans 
 has beans   cried violet beauregarde 
 you re one yourself   said mr wonka   there s no time for arguing  press on  press on   but five seconds later  when a bright red door came into sight ahead  he suddenly waved his gold topped cane in the air and shouted   stop the boat  
  
the inventing room 
everlasting gobstoppers and hair toffee
when mr wonka shouted  stop the boat   the oompa loompas jammed their oars into the
river and backed water furiously  the boat stopped 
the oompa loompas guided the boat alongside the red door  on the door it said inventing room  private   keep out  mr wonka took a key from his pocket  leaned over the side of the boat  and put the key in the keyhole 
 this is the most important room in the entire factory   he said   all my most secret new inventions are cooking and simmering in here  old fickelgruber would give his front teeth to be allowed inside just for three minutes  so would prodnose and slugworth and all the other rotten chocolate makers  but now  listen to me  i want no messing about when you go in  no touching  no meddling  and no tasting  is that agreed  
 yes  yes   the children cried   we won t touch a thing  
 up to now   mr wonka said   nobody else  not even an oompa loompa  has ever been allowed in here   he opened the door and stepped out of the boat into the room  the four children and their parents all scrambled after him 
 don t touch   shouted mr wonka   and don t knock anything over  
charlie bucket stared around the gigantic room in which he now found himself  the place was like a witch s kitchen  all about him black metal pots were boiling and bubbling on huge stoves  and kettles were hissing and pans were sizzling  and strange iron machines were clanking and spluttering  and there were pipes running all over the ceiling and walls  and the whole place was filled with smoke and steam and delicious rich smells 
mr wonka himself had suddenly become even more excited than usual  and anyone could see that this was the room he loved best of all  he was hopping about among the saucepans and the machines like a child among his christmas presents  not knowing which thing to look at first  he lifted the lid from a huge pot and took a sniff  then he rushed over and dipped a finger into a barrel of sticky yellow stuff and had a taste  then he skipped across to one of the machines and turned half a dozen knobs this way and that  then he peered anxiously through the glass door of a gigantic oven  rubbing his hands and cackling with delight at what he saw inside  then he ran over to another machine  a small shiny affair that kept going phut phut phut phut phut  and every time it went phut  a large green marble dropped out of it into a basket on the floor  at least it looked like a marble 
 everlasting gobstoppers   cried mr wonka proudly   they re completely new  i am inventing them for children who are given very little pocket money  you can put an everlasting gob stopper in your mouth and you can suck it and suck it and suck it and suck it and it will never get any smaller  
 it s like gum   cried violet beauregarde 
 it is not like gum   mr wonka said   gum is for chewing  and if you tried chewing one of these gobstoppers here you d break your teeth off  and they never get any smaller  they never disappear  never  at least i don t think they do  there s one of them being tested this very moment in the testing room next door  an oompa loompa is sucking it  he s been sucking it for very nearly a year now without stopping  and it s still just as good as ever 
 now  over here   mr wonka went on  skipping excitedly across the room to the opposite wall   over here i am inventing a completely new line in toffees   he stopped beside a large saucepan  the saucepan was full of a thick gooey purplish treacle  boiling and bubbling  by standing on his toes  little charlie could just see inside it 
 that s hair toffee   cried mr wonka   you eat just one tiny bit of that  and in exactly half an hour a brand new luscious thick silky beautiful crop of hair will start growing out all over the top of your head  and a moustache  and a beard  
 a beard   cried veruca salt   who wants a beard  for heaven s sake  
 it would suit you very well   said mr wonka   but unfortunately the mixture is not quite right yet  i ve got it too strong  it works too well  i tried it on an oompa loompa yesterday in the testing room and immediately a huge black beard started shooting out of his chin  and the beard grew so fast that soon it was trailing all over the floor in a thick hairy carpet  it was growing faster than we could cut it  in the end we had to use a lawn mower to keep it in check  but i ll get the mixture right soon  and when i do  then there ll be no excuse any more for little boys and girls going about with bald heads  
 but mr wonka   said mike teavee   little boys and girls never do go about with  
 don t argue  my dear child  please don t argue   cried mr wonka   it s such a waste of precious time  now  over here  if you will all step this way  i will show you something that i am terrifically proud of  oh  do be careful  don t knock anything over  stand back  
  
the great gum machine
mr wonka led the party over to a gigantic machine that stood in the very centre of the
inventing room  it was a mountain of gleaming metal that towered high above the children
and their parents  out of the very top of it there sprouted hundreds and hundreds of thin
glass tubes  and the glass tubes all curled downwards and came together in a bunch and
hung suspended over an enormous round tub as big as a bath 
 here we go   cried mr wonka  and he pressed three different buttons on the side of the machine  a second later  a mighty rumbling sound came from inside it  and the whole machine began to shake most frighteningly  and steam began hissing out of it all over  and then suddenly the watchers noticed that runny stuff was pouring down the insides of all the hundreds of little glass tubes and squirting out into the great tub below  and in every single tube the runny stuff was of a different colour  so that all the colours of the rainbow  and many others as well  came sloshing and splashing into the tub  it was a lovely sight  and when the tub was nearly full  mr wonka pressed another button  and immediately the runny stuff disappeared  and a whizzing whirring noise took its place  and then a giant whizzer started whizzing round inside the enormous tub  mixing up all the different coloured liquids like an ice cream soda  gradually  the mixture began to froth  it became frothier and frothier  and it turned from blue to white to green to brown to yellow  then back to blue again 
 watch   said mr wonka 
click went the machine  and the whizzer stopped whizzing  and now there came a sort of sucking noise  and very quickly all the blue frothy mixture in the huge basin was sucked back into the stomach of the machine  there was a moment of silence  then a few queer rumblings were heard  then silence again  then suddenly  the machine let out a monstrous mighty groan  and at the same moment a tiny drawer  no bigger than the drawer in a slot machine  popped out of the side of the machine  and in the drawer there lay something so small and thin and grey that everyone thought it must be a mistake  the thing looked like a little strip of grey cardboard 
the children and their parents stared at the little grey strip lying in the drawer 
 you mean that s all   said mike teavee  disgusted 
 that s all   answered mr wonka  gazing proudly at the result   don t you know what it is  
there was a pause  then suddenly  violet beauregarde  the silly gum chewing girl  let out a yell of excitement   by gum  it s gum   she shrieked   it s a stick of chewing gum  
 right you are   cried mr wonka  slapping violet hard on the back   it s a stick of gum  it s a stick of the most amazing and fabulous and sensational gum in the world  
  
good bye violet
 this gum   mr wonka went on   is my latest  my greatest  my most fascinating invention 
it s a chewing gum meal  it s  it s   it s   that tiny little strip of gum lying there is a
whole three course dinner all by itself  
 what sort of nonsense is this   said one of the fathers 
 my dear sir   cried mr wonka   when i start selling this gum in the shops it will change everything  it will be the end of all kitchens and all cooking  there will be no more shopping to do  no more buying of meat and groceries  there ll be no knives and forks at mealtimes  no plates  no washing up  no rubbish  no mess  just a little strip of wonka s magic chewing gum  and that s all you ll ever need at breakfast  lunch  and supper  this piece of gum i ve just made happens to be tomato soup  roast beef  and blueberry pie  but you can have almost anything you want  
 what do you mean  it s tomato soup  roast beef  and blueberry pie   said violet beauregarde 
 if you were to start chewing it   said mr wonka   then that is exactly what you would get on the menu  it s absolutely amazing  you can actually feel the food going down your throat and into your tummy  and you can taste it perfectly  and it fills you up  it satisfies you  it s terrific  
 it s utterly impossible   said veruca salt 
 just so long as it s gum   shouted violet beauregarde   just so long as it s a piece of gum and i can chew it  then that s for me   and quickly she took her own world record piece of chewing gum out of her mouth and stuck it behind her left ear   come on  mr wonka   she said   hand over this magic gum of yours and we ll see if the thing works  
 now  violet   said mrs beauregarde  her mother   don t let s do anything silly  violet    i want the gum   violet said obstinately   what s so silly  
 i would rather you didn t take it   mr wonka told her gently   you see  i haven t got it quite right yet  there are still one or two things  
 oh  to blazes with that   said violet  and suddenly  before mr wonka could stop her  she shot out a fat hand and grabbed the stick of gum out of the little drawer and popped it into her mouth  at once  her huge  well trained jaws started chewing away on it like a pair of tongs 
 don t   said mr wonka 
 fabulous   shouted violet   it s tomato soup  it s hot and creamy and delicious  i can feel it running down my throat  
 stop   said mr wonka   the gum isn t ready yet  it s not right  
 of course it s right   said violet   it s working beautifully  oh my  what lovely soup this is  
 spit it out   said mr wonka 
 it s changing   shouted violet  chewing and grinning both at the same time   the second course is coming up  it s roast beef  it s tender and juicy  oh boy  what a flavour  the baked potato is marvellous  too  it s got a crispy skin and it s all filled with butter inside  
 but how in teresting  violet   said mrs beauregarde   you are a clever girl  
 keep chewing  baby   said mr beauregarde   keep right on chewing  this is a great day for the beauregardes  our little girl is the first person in the world to have a chewing gum meal  
everybody was watching violet beauregarde as she stood there chewing this extraordinary gum  little charlie bucket was staring at her absolutely spellbound  watching her huge rubbery lips as they pressed and unpressed with the chewing  and grandpa joe stood beside him  gaping at the girl  mr wonka was wringing his hands and saying   no  no  no  no  no  it isn t ready for eating  it isn t right  you mustn t do it  
 blueberry pie and cream   shouted violet   here it comes  oh my  it s perfect  it s beautiful  it s  it s exactly as though i m swallowing it  it s as though i m chewing and swallowing great big spoonfuls of the most marvellous blueberry pie in the world  
 good heavens  girl   shrieked mrs beauregarde suddenly  staring at violet   what s happening to your nose  
 oh  be quiet  mother  and let me finish   said violet 
 it s turning blue   screamed mrs beauregarde   your nose is turning blue as a blueberry    your mother is right   shouted mr beauregarde   your whole nose has gone purple    what do you mean   said violet  still chewing away 
 your cheeks   screamed mrs beauregarde   they re turning blue as well  so is your chin  your whole face is turning blue  
 spit that gum out at once   ordered mr beauregarde 
 mercy  save us   yelled mrs beauregarde   the girl s going blue and purple all over  even her hair is changing colour  violet  you re turning violet  violet  what is happening to you  
 i told you i hadn t got it quite right   sighed mr wonka  shaking his head sadly   i ll say you haven t   cried mrs beauregarde   just look at the girl now  
everybody was staring at violet  and what a terrible  peculiar sight she was  her face and hands and legs and neck  in fact the skin all over her body  as well as her great big mop of curly hair  had turned a brilliant  purplish blue  the colour of blueberry juice 
 it always goes wrong when we come to the dessert   sighed mr wonka   it s the blueberry pie that does it  but i ll get it right one day  you wait and see  
 violet   screamed mrs beauregarde   you re swelling up  
 i feel sick   violet said 
 you re swelling up   screamed mrs beauregarde again 
 i feel most peculiar   gasped violet 
 i m not surprised   said mr beauregarde 
 great heavens  girl   screeched mrs beauregarde   you re blowing up like a balloon  
 like a blueberry   said mr wonka 
 call a doctor   shouted mr beauregarde 
 prick her with a pin   said one of the other fathers 
 save her   cried mrs beauregarde  wringing her hands 
but there was no saving her now  her body was swelling up and changing shape at such a rate that within a minute it had turned into nothing less than an enormous round blue ball  a gigantic blueberry  in fact   and all that remained of violet beauregarde herself was a tiny pair of legs and a tiny pair of arms sticking out of the great round fruit and little head on top 
 it always happens like that   sighed mr wonka   i ve tried it twenty times in the testing room on twenty oompa loompas  and every one of them finished up as a blueberry  it s most annoying  i just can t understand it  
 but i don t want a blueberry for a daughter   yelled mrs beauregarde   put her back to what she was this instant  
mr wonka clicked his fingers  and ten oompa loompas appeared immediately at his side 
 roll miss beauregarde into the boat   he said to them   and take her along to the juicing room at once  
 the juicing room   cried mrs beauregarde   what are they going to do to her there  
 squeeze her   said mr wonka   we ve got to squeeze the juice out of her immediately  after that  we ll just have to see how she comes out  but don t worry  my dear mrs beauregarde  we ll get her repaired if it s the last thing we do  i am sorry about it all  i really am  
already the ten oompa loompas were rolling the enormous blueberry across the floor of the inventing room towards the door that led to the chocolate river where the boat was waiting  mr and mrs beauregarde hurried after them  the rest of the party  including little charlie bucket and grandpa joe  stood absolutely still and watched them go 
 listen   whispered charlie   listen  grandpa  the oompa loompas in the boat outside are starting to sing  
the voices  one hundred of them singing together  came loud and clear into the room  dear friends  we surely all agreethere s almost nothing worse to seethan some repulsive little bumwho s always chewing chewing gum  it s very near as bad as thosewho sit around and pick the nose  so please believe us when we saythat chewing gum will never pay this sticky habit s bound to sendthe chewer to a sticky end did any of you ever knowa person called miss bigelow this dreadful woman saw no wrongin chewing  chewing all day long she chewed while bathing in the tub she chewed while dancing at her club she chewed in church and on the bus it really was quite ludicrous and when she couldn t find her gum she d chew up the linoleum or anything that happened near a pair of boots  the postman s ear or other people s underclothes and once she chewed her boy friend s nose she went on chewing till  at last her chewing muscles grew so vastthat from her face her giant chinstuck out just like a violin for years and years she chewed away consuming fifty bits a day until one summer s eve  alas a horrid business came to pass miss bigelow went late to bed for half an hour she lay and read chewing and chewing all the whilelike some great clockwork crocodile at last  she put her gum awayupon a special little tray and settled back and went to sleep  she managed this by counting sheep  but now  how strange  although she slept those massive jaws of hers still kepton chewing  chewing through the night even with nothing there to bite they were  you see  in such a groovethey positively had to move and very grim it was to hearin pitchy darkness  loud and clear this sleeping woman s great big trapopening and shutting  snap snap snap faster and faster  chop chop chop the noise went on  it wouldn t stop until at last her jaws decideto pause and open extra wide and with the most tremendous chewthey bit the lady s tongue in two thereafter  just from chewing gum miss bigelow was always dumb and spent her life shut up in somedisgusting sanatorium and that is why we ll try so hardto save miss violet beauregardefrom suffering an equal fate she s still quite young  it s not too late provided she survives the cure we hope she does  we can t be sure  
  
along the corridor
 well  well  well   sighed mr willy wonka   two naughty little children gone  three good
little children left  i think we d better get out of this room quickly before we lose anyone
else  
 but mr wonka   said charlie bucket anxiously   will violet beauregarde ever be all right again or will she always be a blueberry  
 they ll de juice her in no time flat   declared mr wonka   they ll roll her into the de juicing machine  and she ll come out just as thin as a whistle  
 but will she still be blue all over   asked charlie 
 she ll be purple  cried mr wonka   a fine rich purple from head to toe  but there you are  that s what comes from chewing disgusting gum all day long  
 if you think gum is so disgusting   said mike teavee   then why do you make it in your factory  
 i do wish you wouldn t mumble   said mr wonka   i can t hear a word you re saying  come on  off we go  hurry up  follow me  we re going into the corridors again   and so saying  mr wonka scuttled across to the far end of the inventing room and went out through a small secret door hidden behind a lot of pipes and stoves  the three remaining children  veruca salt  mike teavee  and charlie bucket   together with the five remaining grown ups  followed after him 
charlie bucket saw that they were now back in one of those long pink corridors with many other pink corridors leading out of it  mr wonka was rushing along in front  turning left and right and right and left  and grandpa joe was saying   keep a good hold of my hand  charlie  it would be terrible to get lost in here  
mr wonka was saying   no time for any more messing about  we ll never get anywhere at the rate we ve been going   and on he rushed  down the endless pink corridors  with his black top hat perched on the top of his head and his plum coloured velvet coat tails flying out behind him like a flag in the wind 
they passed a door in the wall   no time to go in   shouted mr wonka   press on  press on  
they passed another door  then another and another  there were doors every twenty paces or so along the corridor now  and they all had something written on them  and strange clanking noises were coming from behind several of them  and delicious smells came wafting through the keyholes  and sometimes little jets of coloured steam shot out from the cracks underneath 
grandpa joe and charlie were half running and half walking to keep up with mr wonka  but they were able to read what it said on quite a few of the doors as they hurried by eatable marshmallow pillows  it said on one 
 marshmallow pillows are terrific   shouted mr wonka as he dashed by   they ll be all the rage when i get them into the shops  no time to go in  though  no time to go in  
lickable wallpaper for nurseries  it said on the next door 
 lovely stuff  lickable wallpaper   cried mr wonka  rushing past   it has pictures of fruits on it  bananas  apples  oranges  grapes  pineapples  strawberries  and snozzberries   
 snozzberries   said mike teavee 
 don t interrupt   said mr wonka   the wallpaper has pictures of all these fruits printed on it  and when you lick the picture of a banana  it tastes of banana  when you lick a strawberry  it tastes of strawberry  and when you lick a snozzberry  it tastes just exactly like a snozzberry  
 but what does a snozzberry taste like  
 you re mumbling again   said mr wonka   speak louder next time  on we go  hurry up  
hot ice creams for cold days  it said on the next door 
 extremely useful in the winter   said mr wonka  rushing on   hot ice cream warms you up no end in freezing weather  i also make hot ice cubes for putting in hot drinks  hot ice cubes make hot drinks hotter  
cows that give chocolate milk  it said on the next door   ah  my pretty little cows   cried mr wonka   how i love those cows  
 but why can t we see them   asked veruca salt   why do we have to go rushing on past all these lovely rooms  
 we shall stop in time   called out mr wonka   don t be so madly impatient  fizzy lifting drinks  it said on the next door 
 oh  those are fabulous   cried mr wonka   they fill you with bubbles  and the bubbles are full of a special kind of gas  and this gas is so terrifically lifting that it lifts you right off the ground just like a balloon  and up you go until your head hits the ceiling  and there you stay  
 but how do you come down again   asked little charlie 
 you do a burp  of course   said mr wonka   you do a great big long rude burp  and up comes the gas and down comes you  but don t drink it outdoors  there s no knowing how high up you ll be carried if you do that  i gave some to an old oompa loompa once out in the back yard and he went up and up and disappeared out of sight  it was very sad  i never saw him again  
 he should have burped   charlie said 
 of course he should have burped   said mr wonka   i stood there shouting   burp  you silly ass  burp  or you ll never come down again   but he didn t or couldn t or wouldn t  i don t know which  maybe he was too polite  he must be on the moon by now  
on the next door  it said square sweets that look round 
 wait   cried mr wonka  skidding suddenly to a halt   i am very proud of my square sweets that look round  let s take a peek  
  
square sweets that look round
everybody stopped and crowded to the door  the top half of the door was made of glass 
grandpa joe lifted charlie up so that he could get a better view  and looking in  charlie saw
a long table  and on the table there were rows and rows of small white square shaped
sweets  the sweets looked very much like square sugar lumps  except that each of them
had a funny little pink face painted on one side  at the end of the table  a number of
oompa loompas were busily painting more faces on more sweets 
 there you are   cried mr wonka   square sweets that look round  
 they don t look round to me   said mike teavee 
 they look square   said veruca salt   they look completely square  
 but they are square   said mr wonka   i never said they weren t  
 you said they were round   said veruca salt 
 i never said anything of the sort   said mr wonka   i said they looked round  
 but they don t look round   said veruca salt   they look square  
 they look round   insisted mr wonka 
 they most certainly do not look round   cried veruca salt 
 veruca  darling   said mrs salt   pay no attention to mr wonka  he s lying to you  
 my dear old fish   said mr wonka   go and boil your head  
 how dare you speak to me like that   shouted mrs salt 
 oh  do shut up   said mr wonka   now watch this  
he took a key from his pocket  and unlocked the door  and flung it open  and suddenly   at the sound of the door opening  all the rows of little square sweets looked quickly round to see who was coming in  the tiny faces actually turned towards the door and stared at mr wonka 
 there you are   he cried triumphantly   they re looking round  there s no argument about it  they are square sweets that look round  
 by golly  he s right   said grandpa joe 
 come on   said mr wonka  starting off down the corridor again   on we go  we mustn t dawdle  
butterscotch and buttergin  it said on the next door they passed   now that sounds a bit more interesting   said mr salt  veruca s father 
 glorious stuff   said mr wonka   the oompa loompas all adore it  it makes them tiddly  listen  you can hear them in there now  whooping it up  
shrieks of laughter and snatches of singing could be heard coming through the closed door 
 they re drunk as lords   said mr wonka   they re drinking butterscotch and soda  they like that best of all  buttergin and tonic is also very popular  follow me  please  we really mustn t keep stopping like this   he turned left  he turned right  they came to a long flight of stairs  mr wonka slid down the banisters  the three children did the same  mrs salt and mrs teavee  the only women now left in the party  were getting very out of breath  mrs salt was a great fat creature with short legs  and she was blowing like a rhinoceros   this way   cried mr wonka  turning left at the bottom of the stairs 
 go slower   panted mrs salt 
 impossible   said mr wonka   we should never get there in time if i did  
 get where   asked veruca salt 
 never you mind   said mr wonka   you just wait and see  
  
veruca in the nut room
mr wonka rushed on down the corridor the nut room  it said on the next door they came to 
 all right   said mr wonka   stop here for a moment and catch your breath  and take a peek through the glass panel of this door  but don t go in  whatever you do  don t go into the nut room  if you go in  you ll disturb the squirrels  
everyone crowded around the door   oh look  grandpa  look   cried charlie   squirrels   shouted veruca salt   crikey   said mike teavee 
it was an amazing sight  one hundred squirrels were seated upon high stools around a large table  on the table  there were mounds and mounds of walnuts  and the squirrels were all working away like mad  shelling the walnuts at a tremendous speed 
 these squirrels are specially trained for getting the nuts out of walnuts   mr wonka explained 
 why use squirrels   mike teavee asked   why not use oompa loompas  
 because   said mr wonka   oompa loompas can t get walnuts out of walnut shells in one piece  they always break them in two  nobody except squirrels can get walnuts whole out of walnut shells every time  it is extremely difficult  but in my factory  i insist upon only whole walnuts  therefore i have to have squirrels to do the job  aren t they wonderful  the way they get those nuts out  and see how they first tap each walnut with their knuckles to be sure it s not a bad one  if it s bad  it makes a hollow sound  and they don t bother to open it  they just throw it down the rubbish chute  there  look  watch that squirrel nearest to us  i think he s got a bad one now  
they watched the little squirrel as he tapped the walnut shell with his knuckles  he cocked his head to one side  listening intently  then suddenly he threw the nut over his shoulder into a large hole in the floor 
 hey  mummy   shouted veruca salt suddenly   i ve decided i want a squirrel  get me one of those squirrels  
 don t be silly  sweetheart   said mrs salt   these all belong to mr wonka  
 i don t care about that   shouted veruca   i want one  all i ve got at home is two dogs and four cats and six bunny rabbits and two parakeets and three canaries and a green parrot and a turtle and a bowl of goldfish and a cage of white mice and a silly old hamster  i want a squirrel  
 all right  my pet   mrs salt said soothingly   mummy ll get you a squirrel just as soon as she possibly can  
 but i don t want any old squirrel   veruca shouted   i want a trained squirrel  
at this point  mr salt  veruca s father  stepped forward   very well  wonka   he said importantly  taking out a wallet full of money   how much d you want for one of these squirrels  name your price  
 they re not for sale   mr wonka answered   she can t have one  
 who says i can t   shouted veruca   i m going in to get myself one this very minute  
 don t   said mr wonka quickly  but he was too late  the girl had already thrown open the door and rushed in 
the moment she entered the room  one hundred squirrels stopped what they were doing and turned their heads and stared at her with small black beady eyes 
veruca salt stopped also  and stared back at them  then her gaze fell upon a pretty little squirrel sitting nearest to her at the end of the table  the squirrel was holding a walnut in its paws 
 all right   veruca said   i ll have you  
she reached out her hands to grab the squirrel  but as she did so   in that first split second when her hands started to go forward  there was a sudden flash of movement in the room  like a flash of brown lightning  and every single squirrel around the table took a flying leap towards her and landed on her body 
twenty five of them caught hold of her right arm  and pinned it down  twenty five more caught hold of her left arm  and pinned that down  twenty five caught hold of her right leg and anchored it to the ground 
twenty four caught hold of her left leg 
and the one remaining squirrel  obviously the leader of them all  climbed up on to her shoulder and started tap tap tapping the wretched girl s head with its knuckles 
 save her   screamed mrs salt   veruca  come back  what are they doing to her    they re testing her to see if she s a bad nut   said mr wonka   you watch  
veruca struggled furiously  but the squirrels held her tight and she couldn t move  the squirrel on her shoulder went tap tap tapping the side of her head with his knuckles 
then all at once  the squirrels pulled veruca to the ground and started carrying her across the floor 
 my goodness  she is a bad nut after all   said mr wonka   her head must have sounded quite hollow  
veruca kicked and screamed  but it was no use  the tiny strong paws held her tightly and she couldn t escape 
 where are they taking her   shrieked mrs salt 
 she s going where all the other bad nuts go   said mr willy wonka   down the rubbish chute  
 by golly  she is going down the chute   said mr salt  staring through the glass door at his daughter 
 then save her   cried mrs salt 
 too late   said mr wonka   she s gone  
and indeed she had 
 but where   shrieked mrs salt  flapping her arms   what happens to the bad nuts  where does the chute go to  
 that particular chute   mr wonka told her   runs directly into the great big main rubbish pipe which carries away all the rubbish from every part of the factory  all the floor sweepings and potato peelings and rotten cabbages and fish heads and stuff like that  
 who eats fish and cabbage and potatoes in this factory  i d like to know   said mike teavee 
 i do  of course   answered mr wonka   you don t think i live on cacao beans  do you  
 but  but   but    shrieked mrs salt   where does the great big pipe go to in the end    why  to the furnace  of course   mr wonka said calmly   to the incinerator   mrs salt opened her huge red mouth and started to scream 
 don t worry   said mr wonka   there s always a chance that they ve decided not to light it today  
 a chance   yelled mrs salt   my darling veruca  she ll  she ll   she ll be sizzled like a sausage  
 quite right  my dear   said mr salt   now see here  wonka   he added   i think you ve gone just a shade too far this time  i do indeed  my daughter may be a bit of a frump  i don t mind admitting it   but that doesn t mean you can roast her to a crisp  i ll have you know i m extremely cross about this  i really am  
 oh  don t be cross  my dear sir   said mr wonka   i expect she ll turn up again sooner or later  she may not even have gone down at all  she may be stuck in the chute just below the entrance hole  and if that s the case  all you ll have to do is go in and pull her up again  
hearing this  both mr and mrs salt dashed into the nut room and ran over to the hole in the floor and peered in 
 veruca   shouted mrs salt   are you down there   there was no answer 
mrs salt bent further forward to get a closer look  she was now kneeling right on the edge of the hole with her head down and her enormous behind sticking up in the air like a giant mushroom  it was a dangerous position to be in  she needed only one tiny little push  one gentle nudge in the right place   and that is exactly what the squirrels gave her  over she toppled  into the hole head first  screeching like a parrot 
 good gracious me   said mr salt  as he watched his fat wife go tumbling down the hole   what a lot of rubbish there s going to be today   he saw her disappearing into the darkness   what s it like down there  angina   he called out  he leaned further forward 
the squirrels rushed up behind him   help   he shouted 
but he was already toppling forward  and down the chute he went  just as his wife had done before him  and his daughter 
 oh dear   cried charlie  who was watching with the others through the door   what on earth s going to happen to them now  
 i expect someone will catch them at the bottom of the chute   said mr wonka   but what about the great fiery incinerator   asked charlie 
 they only light it every other day   said mr wonka   perhaps this is one of the days when they let it go out  you never know  they might be lucky   
 ssshh   said grandpa joe   listen  here comes another song  
from far away down the corridor came the beating of drums  then the singing began 
 veruca salt   sang the oompa loompas  veruca salt  the little brute has just gone down the rubbish chute and as we very rightly thoughtthat in a case like this we oughtto see the thing completely through we ve polished off her parents  too  down goes veruca  down the drain and here  perhaps  we should explainthat she will meet  as she descends a rather different set of friendsto those that she has left behind these won t be nearly so refined a fish head  for example  cutthis morning from a halibut  hello  good morning  how d you do how nice to meet you  how are you  and then a little further downa mass of others gather round a bacon rind  some rancid lard a loaf of bread gone stale and hard a steak that nobody could chew an oyster from an oyster stew some liverwurst so old and greyone swelled it from a mile away a rotten nut  a reeky pear a thing the cat left on the stair and lots of other things as well each with a rather horrid smell these are veruca s new found friendsthat she will meet as she descends and this is the price she has to payfor going so very far astray but now  my dears  we think you mightbe wondering  is it really rightthat every single bit of blameand all the scolding and the shameshould fall upon veruca salt is she the only one at fault for though she s spoiled  and dreadfully so a girl can t spoil herself  you know who spoiled her  then  ah  who indeed who pandered to her every need who turned her into such a brat who are the culprits  who did that alas  you needn t look so farto find out who these sinners are they are  and this is very sad her loving parents  mum and dad and that is why we re glad they fellinto the rubbish chute as well  
  
the great glass lift
 i ve never seen anything like it   cried mr wonka   the children are disappearing like
rabbits  but you mustn t worry about it  they ll all come out in the wash  
mr wonka looked at the little group that stood beside him in the corridor  there were only two children left now  mike teavee and charlie bucket  and there were three grown ups  mr and mrs teavee and grandpa joe   shall we move on   mr wonka asked 
 oh  yes   cried charlie and grandpa joe  both together 
 my feet are getting tired   said mike teavee   i want to watch television  
 if you re tired then we d better take the lift   said mr wonka   it s over here  come on  in we go   he skipped across the passage to a pair of double doors  the doors slid open  the two children and the grown ups went in 
 now then   cried mr wonka   which button shall we press first  take your pick  
charlie bucket stared around him in astonishment  this was the craziest lift he had ever seen  there were buttons everywhere  the walls  and even the ceiling  were covered all over with rows and rows and rows of small  black push buttons  there must have been a thousand of them on each wall  and another thousand on the ceiling  and now charlie noticed that every single button had a tiny printed label beside it telling you which room you would be taken to if you pressed it 
 this isn t just an ordinary up and down lift   announced mr wonka proudly   this lift can go sideways and longways and slantways and any other way you can think of  it can visit any single room in the whole factory  no matter where it is  you simply press the button  and zing    you re off  
 fantastic   murmured grandpa joe  his eyes were shining with excitement as he stared at the rows of buttons 
 the whole lift is made of thick  clear glass   mr wonka declared   walls  doors  ceiling  floor  everything is made of glass so that you can see out  
 but there s nothing to see   said mike teavee 
 choose a button   said mr wonka   the two children may press one button each  so take your pick  hurry up  in every room  something delicious and wonderful is being made  
quickly  charlie started reading some of the labels alongside the buttons 
the rock candy mine         feet deep  it said on one 
cokernut ice skating rinks  it said on another 
then strawberry juice water pistols 
toffee apple trees for planting out in your garden  all sizes 
exploding sweets for your enemies 
luminous lollies for eating in bed at night 
mint jujubes for the boy next door  they ll give him green teeth for a month 
cavity filling caramels  no more dentists  stickjaw for talkative parents 
wriggle sweets that wriggle delightfully in your tummy after swallowing 
invisible chocolate bars for eating in class 
sugar coated pencils for sucking  fizzy lemonade swimming pools 
magic hand fudge  when you hold it in your hand  you taste it in your mouth 
rainbow drops  suck them and you can spit in six different colours 
 come on  come on   cried mr wonka   we can t wait all day    isn t there a television room in all this lot   asked mike teavee 
 certainly there s a television room   mr wonka said   that button over there   he pointed with his finger  everybody looked television chocolate  it said on the tiny label beside the button 
 whoopee   shouted mike teavee   that s for me   he stuck out his thumb and pressed the button  instantly  there was a tremendous whizzing noise  the doors clanged shut and the lift leaped away as though it had been stung by a wasp  but it leapt sideways  and all the passengers  except mr wonka  who was holding on to a strap from the ceiling  were flung off their feet on to the floor 
 get up  get up   cried mr wonka  roaring with laughter  but just as they were staggering to their feet  the lift changed direction and swerved violently round a corner  and over they went once more 
 help   shouted mrs teavee 
 take my hand  madam   said mr wonka gallantly   there you are  now grab this strap  everybody grab a strap  the journey s not over yet  
old grandpa joe staggered to his feet and caught hold of a strap  little charlie  who couldn t possibly reach as high as that  put his arms around grandpa joe s legs and hung on tight 
the lift rushed on at the speed of a rocket  now it was beginning to climb  it was shooting up and up and up on a steep slanty course as if it were climbing a very steep hill  then suddenly  as though it had come to the top of the hill and gone over a precipice  it dropped like a stone and charlie felt his tummy coming right up into his throat  and grandpa joe shouted   yippee  here we go   and mrs teavee cried out   the rope has broken  we re going to crash   and mr wonka said   calm yourself  my dear lady   and patted her comfortingly on the arm  and then grandpa joe looked down at charlie who was clinging to his legs  and he said   are you all right  charlie   charlie shouted   i love it  it s like being on a roller coaster   and through the glass walls of the lift  as it rushed along  they caught sudden glimpses of strange and wonderful things going on in some of the other rooms  an enormous spout with brown sticky stuff oozing out of it on to the floor 
a great  craggy mountain made entirely of fudge  with oompa loompas  all roped together for safety  hacking huge hunks of fudge out of its sides 
a machine with white powder spraying out of it like a snowstorm  a lake of hot caramel with steam coming off it  
a village of oompa loompas  with tiny houses and streets and hundreds of oompa loompa children no more than four inches high playing in the streets 
and now the lift began flattening out again  but it seemed to be going faster than ever  and charlie could hear the scream of the wind outside as it hurtled forward      and it twisted  and it turned   and it went up   and it went down   and  
 i m going to be sick   yelled mrs teavee  turning green in the face   please don t be sick   said mr wonka   try and stop me   said mrs teavee 
 then you d better take this   said mr wonka  and he swept his magnificent black top hat off his head  and held it out  upside down  in front of mrs teavee s mouth 
 make this awful thing stop   ordered mr teavee 
 can t do that   said mr wonka   it won t stop till we get there  i only hope no one s using the other lift at this moment  
 what other lift   screamed mrs teavee 
 the one that goes the opposite way on the same track as this one   said mr wonka 
 holy mackerel   cried mr teavee   you mean we might have a collision  
 i ve always been lucky so far   said mr wonka 
 now i am going to be sick   yelled mrs teavee 
 no  no   said mr wonka   not now  we re nearly there  don t spoil my hat  
the next moment  there was a screaming of brakes  and the lift began to slow down  then it stopped altogether 
 some ride   said mr teavee  wiping his great sweaty face with a handkerchief 
 never again   gasped mrs teavee  and then the doors of the lift slid open and mr wonka said   just a minute now  listen to me  i want everybody to be very careful in this room  there is dangerous stuff around in here and you must not tamper with it  
  
the television chocolate room
the teavee family  together with charlie and grandpa joe  stepped out of the lift into a
room so dazzlingly bright and dazzlingly white that they screwed up their eyes in pain and
stopped walking  mr wonka handed each of them a pair of dark glasses and said   put these
on quick  and don t take them off in here whatever you do  this light could blind you  
as soon as charlie had his dark glasses on  he was able to look around him in comfort  he saw a long narrow room  the room was painted white all over  even the floor was white  and there wasn t a speck of dust anywhere  from the ceiling  huge lamps hung down and bathed the room in a brilliant blue white light  the room was completely bare except at the far ends  at one of these ends there was an enormous camera on wheels  and a whole army of oompa loompas was clustering around it  oiling its joints and adjusting its knobs and polishing its great glass lens  the oompa loompas were all dressed in the most extraordinary way  they were wearing bright red space suits  complete with helmets and goggles  at least they looked like space suits   and they were working in complete silence  watching them  charlie experienced a queer sense of danger  there was something dangerous about this whole business  and the oompa loompas knew it  there was no chattering or singing among them here  and they moved about over the huge black camera slowly and carefully in their scarlet space suits 
at the other end of the room  about fifty paces away from the camera  a single oompa loompa  also wearing a space suit  was sitting at a black table gazing at the screen of a very large television set 
 here we go   cried mr wonka  hopping up and down with excitement   this is the testing room for my very latest and greatest invention  television chocolate  
 but what is television chocolate   asked mike teavee 
 good heavens  child  stop interrupting me   said mr wonka   it works by television  i don t like television myself  i suppose it s all right in small doses  but children never seem to be able to take it in small doses  they want to sit there all day long staring and staring at the screen  
 that s me   said mike teavee 
 shut up   said mr teavee 
 thank you   said mr wonka   i shall now tell you how this amazing television set of mine works  but first of all  do you know how ordinary television works  it is very simple  at one end  where the picture is being taken  you have a large cine camera and you start photographing something  the photographs are then split up into millions of tiny little pieces which are so small that you can t see them  and these little pieces are shot out into the sky by electricity  in the sky  they go whizzing around all over the place until suddenly they hit the antenna on the roof of somebody s house  they then go flashing down the wire that leads right into the back of the television set  and in there they get jiggled and joggled around until at last every single one of those millions of tiny pieces is fitted back into its right place  just like a jigsaw puzzle   and presto   the photograph appears on the screen   
 that isn t exactly how it works   mike teavee said 
 i am a little deaf in my left ear   mr wonka said   you must forgive me if i don t hear everything you say  
 i said  that isn t exactly how it works   shouted mike teavee 
 you re a nice boy   mr wonka said   but you talk too much  now then  the very first time i saw ordinary television working  i was struck by a tremendous idea   look here   i shouted   if these people can break up a photograph into millions of pieces and send the pieces whizzing through the air and then put them together again at the other end  why can t i do the same thing with a bar of chocolate  why can t i send a real bar of chocolate whizzing through the air in tiny pieces and then put the pieces together at the other end  all ready to be eaten   
 impossible   said mike teavee 
 you think so   cried mr wonka   well  watch this  i shall now send a bar of my very best chocolate from one end of this room to the other  by television  get ready  there  bring in the chocolate  
immediately  six oompa loompas marched forward carrying on their shoulders the most enormous bar of chocolate charlie had ever seen  it was about the size of the mattress he slept on at home 
 it has to be big   mr wonka explained   because whenever you send something by television  it always comes out much smaller than it was when it went in  even with ordinary television  when you photograph a big man  he never comes out on your screen any taller than a pencil  does he  here we go  then  get ready  no  no  stop  hold everything  you there  mike teavee  stand back  you re too close to the camera  there are dangerous rays coming out of that thing  they could break you up into a million tiny pieces in one second  that s why the oompa loompas are wearing space suits  the suits protect them  all right  that s better  now  then  switch on  
one of the oompa loompas caught hold of a large switch and pulled it down 
there was a blinding flash 
 the chocolate s gone   shouted grandpa joe  waving his arms 
he was quite right  the whole enormous bar of chocolate had disappeared completely into thin air 
 it s on its way   cried mr wonka   it is now rushing through the air above our heads in a million tiny pieces  quick  come over here   he dashed over to the other end of the room where the large television set was standing  and the others followed him   watch the screen   he cried   here it comes  look  
the screen flickered and lit up  then suddenly  a small bar of chocolate appeared in the middle of the screen 
 take it   shouted mr wonka  growing more and more excited 
 how can you take it   asked mike teavee  laughing   it s just a picture on a television screen  
 charlie bucket   cried mr wonka   you take it  reach out and grab it  
charlie put out his hand and touched the screen  and suddenly  miraculously  the bar of chocolate came away in his fingers  he was so surprised he nearly dropped it 
 eat it   shouted mr wonka   go on and eat it  it ll be delicious  it s the same bar  it s got smaller on the journey  that s all  
 it s absolutely fantastic   gasped grandpa joe   it s  it s   it s a miracle  
 just imagine   cried mr wonka   when i start using this across the country  you ll be sitting at home watching television and suddenly a commercial will flash on to the screen and a voice will say   eat wonka s chocolates  they re the best in the world  if you don t believe us  try one for yourself   now   and you simply reach out and take one  how about that  eh  
 terrific   cried grandpa joe   it will change the world  
  
mike teavee is sent by television
mike teavee was even more excited than grandpa joe at seeing a bar of chocolate being sent by television   but mr wonka   he shouted   can you send other things through the air in the same way  breakfast cereal  for instance  
 oh  my sainted aunt   cried mr wonka   don t mention that disgusting stuff in front of me  do you know what breakfast cereal is made of  it s made of all those little curly wooden shavings you find in pencil sharpeners  
 but could you send it by television if you wanted to  as you do chocolate   asked mike teavee 
 of course i could  
 and what about people   asked mike teavee   could you send a real live person from one place to another in the same way  
 a person   cried mr wonka   are you off your rocker    but could it be done  
 good heavens  child  i really don t know  i suppose it could   yes  i m pretty sure it could   of course it could   i wouldn t like to risk it  though   it might have some very nasty results   
but mike teavee was already off and running  the moment he heard mr wonka saying   i m pretty sure it could  of course it could   he turned away and started running as fast as he could towards the other end of the room where the great camera was standing   look at me   he shouted as he ran   i m going to be the first person in the world to be sent by television  
 no  no  no  no   cried mr wonka 
 mike   screamed mrs teavee   stop  come back  you ll be turned into a million tiny pieces  
but there was no stopping mike teavee now  the crazy boy rushed on  and when he reached the enormous camera  he jumped straight for the switch  scattering oompa loompas right and left as he went 
 see you later  alligator   he shouted  and he pulled down the switch  and as he did so  he leaped out into the full glare of the mighty lens 
there was a blinding flash  then there was silence 
then mrs teavee ran forward  but she stopped dead in the middle of the room   and she stood there   she stood staring at the place where her son had been   and her great red mouth opened wide and she screamed   he s gone  he s gone  
 great heavens  he has gone   shouted mr teavee 
mr wonka hurried forward and placed a hand gently on mrs teavee s shoulder   we shall have to hope for the best   he said   we must pray that your little boy will come out unharmed at the other end  
 mike   screamed mrs teavee  clasping her head in her hands   where are you  
 i ll tell you where he is   said mr teavee   he s whizzing around above our heads in a million tiny pieces  
 don t talk about it   wailed mrs teavee 
 we must watch the television set   said mr wonka   he may come through any moment  
mr and mrs teavee and grandpa joe and little charlie and mr wonka all gathered round the television and stared tensely at the screen  the screen was quite blank 
 he s taking a heck of a long time to come across   said mr teavee  wiping his brow   oh dear  oh dear   said mr wonka   i do hope that no part of him gets left behind    what on earth do you mean   asked mr teavee sharply 
 i don t wish to alarm you   said mr wonka   but it does sometimes happen that only about half the little pieces find their way into the television set  it happened last week  i don t know why  but the result was that only half a bar of chocolate came through  
mrs teavee let out a scream of horror   you mean only a half of mike is coming back to us   she cried 
 let s hope it s the top half   said mr teavee 
 hold everything   said mr wonka   watch the screen  something s happening  
the screen had suddenly begun to flicker 
then some wavy lines appeared 
mr wonka adjusted one of the knobs and the wavy lines went away 
and now  very slowly  the screen began to get brighter and brighter 
 here he comes   yelled mr wonka   yes  that s him all right  
 is he all in one piece   cried mrs teavee 
 i m not sure   said mr wonka   it s too early to tell  
faintly at first  but becoming clearer and clearer every second  the picture of mike teavee appeared on the screen  he was standing up and waving at the audience and grinning from ear to ear 
 but he s a midget   shouted mr teavee 
 mike   cried mrs teavee   are you all right  are there any bits of you missing  
 isn t he going to get any bigger   shouted mr teavee 
 talk to me  mike   cried mrs teavee   say something  tell me you re all right  
a tiny little voice  no louder than the squeaking of a mouse  came out of the television set   hi  mum   it said   hi  pop  look at me  i m the first person ever to be sent by television  
 grab him   ordered mr wonka   quick  
mrs teavee shot out a hand and picked the tiny figure of mike teavee out of the screen 
 hooray   cried mr wonka   he s all in one piece  he s completely unharmed  
 you call that unharmed   snapped mrs teavee  peering at the little speck of a boy who was now running to and fro across the palm of her hand  waving his pistols in the air 
he was certainly not more than an inch tall 
 he s shrunk   said mr teavee 
 of course he s shrunk   said mr wonka   what did you expect  
 this is terrible   wailed mrs teavee   what are we going to do  
and mr teavee said   we can t send him back to school like this  he ll get trodden on  he ll get squashed  
 he won t be able to do anything   cried mrs teavee 
 oh  yes i will   squeaked the tiny voice of mike teavee   i ll still be able to watch television  
 never again   shouted mr teavee   i m throwing the television set right out the window the moment we get home  i ve had enough of television  
when he heard this  mike teavee flew into a terrible tantrum  he started jumping up and down on the palm of his mother s hand  screaming and yelling and trying to bite her fingers   i want to watch television   he squeaked   i want to watch television  i want to watch television  i want to watch television  
 here  give him to me   said mr teavee  and he took the tiny boy and shoved him into the breast pocket of his jacket and stuffed a handkerchief on top  squeals and yells came from inside the pocket  and the pocket shook as the furious little prisoner fought to get out 
 oh  mr wonka   wailed mrs teavee   how can we make him grow  
 well   said mr wonka  stroking his beard and gazing thoughtfully at the ceiling   i must say that s a wee bit tricky  but small boys are extremely springy and elastic  they stretch like mad  so what we ll do  we ll put him in a special machine i have for testing the stretchiness of chewing gum  maybe that will bring him back to what he was  
 oh  thank you   said mrs teavee 
 don t mention it  dear lady  
 how far d you think he ll stretch   asked mr teavee 
 maybe miles   said mr wonka   who knows  but he s going to be awfully thin  everything gets thinner when you stretch it  
 you mean like chewing gum   asked mr teavee 
 exactly  
 how thin will he be   asked mrs teavee anxiously 
 i haven t the foggiest idea   said mr wonka   and it doesn t really matter  anyway  because we ll soon fatten him up again  all we ll have to do is give him a triple overdose of my wonderful supervitamin chocolate  supervitamin chocolate contains huge amounts of vitamin a and vitamin b  it also contains vitamin c  vitamin d  vitamin e  vitamin f  vitamin g  vitamin i  vitamin j  vitamin k  vitamin l  vitamin m  vitamin n  vitamin o  vitamin p  vitamin q  vitamin r  vitamin t  vitamin u  vitamin v  vitamin w  vitamin x  vitamin y  and  believe it or not  vitamin z  the only two vitamins it doesn t have in it are vitamin s  because it makes you sick  and vitamin h  because it makes you grow horns on the top of your head  like a bull  but it does have in it a very small amount of the rarest and most magical vitamin of them all  vitamin wonka  
 and what will that do to him   asked mr teavee anxiously 
 it ll make his toes grow out until they re as long as his fingers  
 oh  no   cried mrs teavee 
 don t be silly   said mr wonka   it s most useful  he ll be able to play the piano with his feet  
 but mr wonka  
 no arguments  please   said mr wonka  he turned away and clicked his fingers three times in the air  an oompa loompa appeared immediately and stood beside him   follow these orders   said mr wonka  handing the oompa loompa a piece of paper on which he had written full instructions   and you ll find the boy in his father s pocket  off you go  good bye  mr teavee  good bye  mrs teavee  and please don t look so worried  they all come out in the wash  you know  every one of them  
at the end of the room  the oompa loompas around the giant camera were already beating their tiny drums and beginning to jog up and down to the rhythm 
 there they go again   said mr wonka   i m afraid you can t stop them singing  
little charlie caught grandpa joe s hand  and the two of them stood beside mr wonka in the middle of the long bright room  listening to the oompa loompas  and this is what they sang  the most important thing we ve learned so far as children are concerned is never  never  never letthem near your television set or better still  just don t installthe idiotic thing at all in almost every house we ve been we ve watched them gaping at the screen they loll and slop and lounge about and stare until their eyes pop out  last week in someone s place we sawa dozen eyeballs on the floor  they sit and stare and stare and situntil they re hypnotized by it until they re absolutely drunkwith all that shocking ghastly junk oh yes  we know it keeps them still they don t climb out the window sill they never fight or kick or punch they leave you free to cook the lunchand wash the dishes in the sink but did you ever stop to think to wonder just exactly whatthis does to your beloved tot it rots the senses in the head it kills imagination dead it clogs and clutters up the mind it makes a child so dull and blindhe can no longer understanda fantasy  a fairyland his brain becomes as soft as cheese his powers of thinking rust and freeze he cannot think  he only sees  all right   you ll cry   all right   you ll say  but if we take the set away what shall we do to entertainour darling children  please explain  we ll answer this by asking you  what used the darling ones to do how used they keep themselves contentedbefore this monster was invented  have you forgotten  don t you know we ll say it very loud and slow they  used to   read  they d read and read and read and read  and then proceedto read some more  great scott  gadzooks one half their lives was reading books the nursery shelves held books galore books cluttered up the nursery floor and in the bedroom  by the bed more books were waiting to be read such wondrous  fine  fantastic talesof dragons  gypsies  queens  and whalesand treasure isles  and distant shoreswhere smugglers rowed with muffled oars and pirates wearing purple pants and sailing ships and elephants and cannibals crouching round the pot stirring away at something hot  it smells so good  what can it be good gracious  it s penelope  the younger ones had beatrix potterwith mr tod  the dirty rotter and squirrel nutkin  pigling bland and mrs tiggy winkle and just how the camel got his hump and how the monkey lost his rump and mr toad  and bless my soul there s mr rat and mr mole oh  books  what books they used to know those children living long ago so please  oh please  we beg  we pray go throw your tv set away and in its place you can installa lovely bookshelf on the wall then fill the shelves with lots of books ignoring all the dirty looks the screams and yells  the bites and kicks and children hitting you with sticks fear not  because we promise youthat  in about a week or twoof having nothing else to do they ll now begin to feel the needof having something good to read and once they start  oh boy  oh boy you watch the slowly growing joythat fills their hearts  they ll grow so keenthey ll wonder what they d ever seenin that ridiculous machine that nauseating  foul  unclean repulsive television screen and later  each and every kidwill love you more for what you did p s  regarding mike teavee we very much regret that weshall simply have to wait and seeif we can get him back his height but if we can t  it serves him right  
  
only charlie left
 which room shall it be next   said mr wonka as he turned away and darted into the lift 
 come on  hurry up  we must get going  and how many children are there left now  
little charlie looked at grandpa joe  and grandpa joe looked back at little charlie   but mr wonka   grandpa joe called after him   there s  there s only charlie left now  
mr wonka swung round and stared at charlie 
there was a silence  charlie stood there holding tightly on to grandpa joe s hand   you mean you re the only one left   mr wonka said  pretending to be surprised   why  yes   whispered charlie   yes  
mr wonka suddenly exploded with excitement   but my dear boy   he cried out   that means you ve won   he rushed out of the lift and started shaking charlie s hand so furiously it nearly came off   oh  i do congratulate you   he cried   i really do  i m absolutely delighted  it couldn t be better  how wonderful this is  i had a hunch  you know  right from the beginning  that it was going to be you  well done  charlie  well done  this is terrific  now the fun is really going to start  but we mustn t dilly  we mustn t dally  there s even less time to lose now than there was before  we have an enormous number of things to do before the day is out  just think of the arrangements that have to be made  and the people we have to fetch  but luckily for us  we have the great glass lift to speed things up  jump in  my dear charlie  jump in  you too  grandpa joe  sir  no  no  after you  that s the way  now then  this time i shall choose the button we are going to press   mr wonka s bright twinkling blue eyes rested for a moment on charlie s face 
something crazy is going to happen now  charlie thought  but he wasn t frightened  he wasn t even nervous  he was just terrifically excited  and so was grandpa joe  the old man s face was shining with excitement as he watched every move that mr wonka made  mr wonka was reaching for a button high up on the glass ceiling of the lift  charlie and grandpa joe both craned their necks to read what it said on the little label beside the button 
it said  up and out 
 up and out   thought charlie   what sort of a room is that   mr wonka pressed the button  the glass doors closed   hold on   cried mr wonka 
then wham  the lift shot straight up like a rocket   yippee   shouted grandpa joe  charlie was clinging to grandpa joe s legs and mr wonka was holding on to a strap from the ceiling  and up they went  up  up  up  straight up this time  with no twistings or turnings  and charlie could hear the whistling of the air outside as the lift went faster and faster   yippee   shouted grandpa joe again   yippee  here we go  
 faster   cried mr wonka  banging the wall of the lift with his hand   faster  faster  if we don t go any faster than this  we shall never get through  
 through what   shouted grandpa joe   what have we got to get through  
 ah ha   cried mr wonka   you wait and see  i ve been longing to press this button for years  but i ve never done it until now  i was tempted many times  oh  yes  i was tempted  but i couldn t bear the thought of making a great big hole in the roof of the factory  here we go  boys  up and out  
 but you don t mean   shouted grandpa joe     you don t really mean that this lift     oh yes  i do   answered mr wonka   you wait and see  up and out  
 but  but   but   it s made of glass   shouted grandpa joe   it ll break into a million pieces  
 i suppose it might   said mr wonka  cheerful as ever   but it s pretty thick glass  all the same  
the lift rushed on  going up and up and up  faster and faster and faster 
then suddenly  crash   and the most tremendous noise of splintering wood and broken tiles came from directly above their heads  and grandpa joe shouted   help  it s the end  we re done for   and mr wonka said   no  we re not  we re through  we re out   sure enough  the lift had shot right up through the roof of the factory and was now rising into the sky like a rocket  and the sunshine was pouring in through the glass roof  in five seconds they were a thousand feet up in the sky 
 the lift s gone mad   shouted grandpa joe 
 have no fear  my dear sir   said mr wonka calmly  and he pressed another button  the lift stopped  it stopped and hung in mid air  hovering like a helicopter  hovering over the factory and over the very town itself which lay spread out below them like a picture postcard  looking down through the glass floor on which he was standing  charlie could see the small far away houses and the streets and the snow that lay thickly over everything  it was an eerie and frightening feeling to be standing on clear glass high up in the sky  it made you feel that you weren t standing on anything at all 
 are we all right   cried grandpa joe   how does this thing stay up  
 sugar power   said mr wonka   one million sugar power  oh  look   he cried  pointing down   there go the other children  they re returning home  
  
the other children go home
 we must go down and take a look at our little friends before we do anything else   said mr wonka  he pressed a different button  and the lift dropped lower  and soon it was hovering just above the entrance gates to the factory 
looking down now  charlie could see the children and their parents standing in a little group just inside the gates 
 i can only see three   he said   who s missing  
 i expect it s mike teavee   mr wonka said   but he ll be coming along soon  do you see the trucks   mr wonka pointed to a line of gigantic covered vans parked in a line near by 
 yes   charlie said   what are they for  
 don t you remember what it said on the golden tickets  every child goes home with a lifetime s supply of sweets  there s one truckload for each of them  loaded to the brim  ah ha   mr wonka went on   there goes our friend augustus gloop  d you see him  he s getting into the first truck with his mother and father  
 you mean he s really all right   asked charlie  astonished   even after going up that awful pipe  
 he s very much all right   said mr wonka 
 he s changed   said grandpa joe  peering down through the glass wall of the elevator   he used to be fat  now he s thin as a straw  
 of course he s changed   said mr wonka  laughing   he got squeezed in the pipe  don t you remember  and look  there goes miss violet beauregarde  the great gum chewer  it seems as though they managed to de juice her after all  i m so glad  and how healthy she looks  much better than before  
 but she s purple in the face   cried grandpa joe 
 so she is   said mr wonka   ah  well  there s nothing we can do about that  
 good gracious   cried charlie   look at poor veruca salt and mr salt and mrs salt  they re simply covered with rubbish  
 and here comes mike teavee   said grandpa joe   good heavens  what have they done to him  he s about ten feet tall and thin as a wire  
 they ve overstretched him on the gum stretching machine   said mr wonka   how very careless  
 but how dreadful for him   cried charlie 
 nonsense   said mr wonka   he s very lucky  every basketball team in the country will be trying to get him  but now   he added   it is time we left these four silly children  i have something very important to talk to you about  my dear charlie   mr wonka pressed another button  and the lift swung upwards into the sky 
  
charlie s chocolate factory
the great glass lift was now hovering high over the town  inside the lift stood mr wonka 
grandpa joe  and little charlie 
 how i love my chocolate factory   said mr wonka  gazing down  then he paused  and he turned around and looked at charlie with a most serious expression on his face   do you love it too  charlie   he asked 
 oh  yes   cried charlie   i think it s the most wonderful place in the whole world  
 i am very pleased to hear you say that   said mr wonka  looking more serious than ever  he went on staring at charlie   yes   he said   i am very pleased indeed to hear you say that  and now i shall tell you why   mr wonka cocked his head to one side and all at once the tiny twinkling wrinkles of a smile appeared around the corners of his eyes  and he said   you see  my dear boy  i have decided to make you a present of the whole place  as soon as you are old enough to run it  the entire factory will become yours  
charlie stared at mr wonka  grandpa joe opened his mouth to speak  but no words came out 
 it s quite true   mr wonka said  smiling broadly now   i really am giving it to you  that s all right  isn t it  
 giving it to him   gasped grandpa joe   you must be joking  
 i m not joking  sir  i m deadly serious  
 but  but   why should you want to give your factory to little charlie  
 listen   mr wonka said   i m an old man  i m much older than you think  i can t go on for ever  i ve got no children of my own  no family at all  so who is going to run the factory when i get too old to do it myself  someone s got to keep it going  if only for the sake of the oompa loompas  mind you  there are thousands of clever men who would give anything for the chance to come in and take over from me  but i don t want that sort of person  i don t want a grown up person at all  a grown up won t listen to me  he won t learn  he will tryto do things his own way and not mine  so i have to have a child  i want a good sensible loving child  one to whom i can tell all my most precious sweet making secrets   while i am still alive  
 so that is why you sent out the golden tickets   cried charlie 
 exactly   said mr wonka   i decided to invite five children to the factory  and the one i liked best at the end of the day would be the winner  
 but mr wonka   stammered grandpa joe   do you really and truly mean that you are giving the whole of this enormous factory to little charlie  after all  
 there s no time for arguments   cried mr wonka   we must go at once and fetch the rest of the family  charlie s father and his mother and anyone else that s around  they can all live in the factory from now on  they can all help to run it until charlie is old enough to do it by himself  where do you live  charlie  
charlie peered down through the glass floor at the snow covered houses that lay below   it s over there   he said  pointing   it s that little cottage right on the edge of the town  the tiny little one  
 i see it   cried mr wonka  and he pressed some more buttons and the lift shot down towards charlie s house 
 i m afraid my mother won t come with us   charlie said sadly   why ever not  
 because she won t leave grandma josephine and grandma georgina and grandpa george  
 but they must come too  
 they can t   charlie said   they re very old and they haven t been out of bed for twenty years  
 then we ll take the bed along as well  with them in it   said mr wonka   there s plenty of room in this lift for a bed  
 you couldn t get the bed out of the house   said grandpa joe   it won t go through the door  
 you mustn t despair   cried mr wonka   nothing is impossible  you watch  
the lift was now hovering over the roof of the buckets  little house 
 what are you going to do   cried charlie 
 i m going right on in to fetch them   said mr wonka 
 how   asked grandpa joe 
 through the roof   said mr wonka  pressing another button 
 no   shouted charlie 
 stop   shouted grandpa joe 
crash went the lift  right down through the roof of the house into the old people s bedroom  showers of dust and broken tiles and bits of wood and cockroaches and spiders and bricks and cement went raining down on the three old ones who were lying in bed  and each of them thought that the end of the world was come  grandma georgina fainted  grandma josephine dropped her false teeth  grandpa george put his head under the blanket  and mr and mrs bucket came rushing in from the next room 
 save us   cried grandma josephine 
 calm yourself  my darling wife   said grandpa joe  stepping out of the lift   it s only us  
 mother   cried charlie  rushing into mrs bucket s arms   mother  mother  listen to what s happened  we re all going back to live in mr wonka s factory and we re going to help him to run it and he s given it all to me and  and   and   and   
 what are you talking about   said mrs bucket 
 just look at our house   cried poor mr bucket   it s in ruins  
 my dear sir   said mr wonka  jumping forward and shaking mr bucket warmly by the hand   i m so very glad to meet you  you mustn t worry about your house  from now on  you re never going to need it again  anyway  
 who is this crazy man   screamed grandma josephine   he could have killed us all    this   said grandpa joe   is mr willy wonka himself
it took quite a time for grandpa joe and charlie to explain to everyone exactly what had been happening to them all day  and even then they all refused to ride back to the factory in the lift 
 i d rather die in my bed   shouted grandma josephine 
 so would i   cried grandma georgina 
 i refuse to go   announced grandpa george 
so mr wonka and grandpa joe and charlie  taking no notice of their screams  simply pushed the bed into the lift  they pushed mr and mrs bucket in after it  then they got in themselves  mr wonka pressed a button  the doors closed  grandma georgina screamed  and the lift rose up off the floor and shot through the hole in the roof  out into the open sky 
charlie climbed on to the bed and tried to calm the three old people who were still petrified with fear   please don t be frightened   he said   it s quite safe  and we re going to the most wonderful place in the world  
 charlie s right   said grandpa joe 
 will there be anything to eat when we get there   asked grandma josephine   i m starving  the whole family is starving  
 anything to eat   cried charlie laughing   oh  you just wait and see
